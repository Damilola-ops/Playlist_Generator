Child take note in the wild, this that kingdom come
Black skin, white world, that's my thesis done
Rock, paper, scissors, the mission is classified
I was doing nine-to-five, I been lost in who am Is
Who are you, who are we?
I'm obsessed with breaking free
Big woman Enny but for aunty, I still bend my knee

Stop
You stop it

[Verse 1: Boj]
Home girl wanna get it
Her boyfriend kinda livid
Every story got two sides
He ain't even tryna listen
She was feeling on my steez bro
I was swishing like a free throw eh
Fucking with my lingo
Now she come dey find me like nemo
I just wanna kiss her
I just wanna kiss her on the lips ha
Baby tell your mister
Tell your mister hasta la vista

[Hook: Boj]
If you like I'm ready to take the deal
I just want you to tell me just how you feel

[Chorus:]
What we fi do? We're stuck in a loop
Nobody's gonna win this game
Can't leave him, cannot leave my baby
What we fi do? keep it on a low
Nobody's gonna win this gamе
Can't lеave him, cannot leavе my baby

Sweet baby melanin sweeter than sugarcane
Give her hickey hickey on her neck
Sex like a gangster but my face innocent
Stroke her pussy with my index

Tapping on her pussy like I'm tryna kill a motherfucking insect
Oh-ah-ah-ah
