When you do like that
You make me wan move right back
Why can't we move time back
Why can’t we do like that

If I was Moses I'll part seas and move mountains Your heart bleeds for a new accountant, coz it was stolen
I should've taken more care when I stepped up to be the one that you had chosen

I wish we could go back, but time doesn’t care about missed opportunities, or lies we both use
Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I’m falling

High for my baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it

I made mistakes, I can’t forget it
I felt your love, it's incandescence
Nothing’s changed except addresses

the song duduke is about “simi” unborn child that she can’t wait to see
“Duduke means – it’s the beat of your heart or the beat of the drums you move your body to, or the beat you sing a melody to – it’s whatever beat you want it to be
The beautiful singer who is currently expecting her first child with singer and hubby, Adekunle Gold, posted a totally adorable video of herself dancing to her new song, Duduke

Why can’t we do like that

If I was Moses I'll part seas and move mountains Your heart bleeds for a new accountant, coz it was stolen
I should've taken more care when I stepped up to be the one that you had chosen

I wish we could go back, but time doesn’t care about missed opportunities, or lies we both use
Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I’m falling

High for my baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it

I made mistakes, I can’t forget it
I felt your love, it's incandescence
Nothing’s changed except addresses

the song duduke is about “simi” unborn child that she can’t wait to see
“Duduke means – it’s the beat of your heart or the beat of the drums you move your body to, or the beat you sing a melody to – it’s whatever beat you want it to be
The beautiful singer who is currently expecting her first child with singer and hubby, Adekunle Gold, posted a totally adorable video of herself dancing to her new song, Duduke

Ride for me baby you know I must admit
When you do like that
You make me wan move right back
Why can't we move time back
Why can’t we do like that

If I was Moses I'll part seas and move mountains Your heart bleeds for a new accountant, coz it was stolen
I should've taken more care when I stepped up to be the one that you had chosen

I wish we could go back, but time doesn’t care about missed opportunities, or lies we both use
Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I’m falling

High for my baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit

I made mistakes, I can’t forget it
I felt your love, it's incandescence
Nothing’s changed except addresses
One song can't hold all my confessions

I had to realize sometimes falling is the biggest step that we ever take
All I need is a leap of faith


Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more

Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I'm falling

the song duduke is about “simi” unborn child that she can’t wait to see
“Duduke means – it’s the beat of your heart or the beat of the drums you move your body to, or the beat you sing a melody to – it’s whatever beat you want it to be
The beautiful singer who is currently expecting her first child with singer and hubby, Adekunle Gold, posted a totally adorable video of herself dancing to her new song, Duduke

No no oh

Ke ma foshi lo mi
I don’t fuck around, ask anybody to mo mi
No
You no be my enemy
But you ain’t no friend to me
Cause' people ride for the people that ride for them too
If you’re riding for me, then I’m riding with you
See I say what I mean, so I tell you the truth
And now we’re through (And now we're through)
Me I only give what I’m wanting
You do me right I match your enеrgy
Everybody need somebody good
Somebody nicе, somebody reliable
I’m just tryna keep my spirit pure
Stay the fuck away from immature people
It’s okay if I only have four people
As long as them be sure people

[Chorus: Simi Fave]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Are you, lo-lo-lo-loyal?
Lo-lo-lo-loyal
'Cause I'm, lo-lo-lo-loyal

Wake up wake up

Stick up stick up for me
I’ll see ya sooner than the dude at Bethsaida
Shey na wetin you talk
Shey na you wey comot

Why can’t we do like that

If I was Moses I'll part seas and move mountains Your heart bleeds for a new accountant, coz it was stolen
I should've taken more care when I stepped up to be the one that you had chosen

I wish we could go back, but time doesn’t care about missed opportunities, or lies we both use
Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more

the song duduke is about “simi” unborn child that she can’t wait to see
“Duduke means – it’s the beat of your heart or the beat of the drums you move your body to, or the beat you sing a melody to – it’s whatever beat you want it to be
The beautiful singer who is currently expecting her first child with singer and hubby, Adekunle Gold, posted a totally adorable video of herself dancing to her new song, Duduke

Cause' people ride for the people that ride for them too
If you’re riding for me, then I’m riding with you
See I say what I mean, so I tell you the truth
And now we’re through (And now we're through)
Me I only give what I’m wanting
You do me right I match your enеrgy
Everybody need somebody good
Somebody nicе, somebody reliable

Stay the fuck away from immature people
It’s okay if I only have four people
As long as them be sure people

Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in

the song duduke is about “simi” unborn child that she can’t wait to see
“Duduke means – it’s the beat of your heart or the beat of the drums you move your body to, or the beat you sing a melody to – it’s whatever beat you want it to be

the song duduke is about “simi” unborn child that she can’t wait to see
“Duduke means – it’s the beat of your heart or the beat of the drums you move your body to, or the beat you sing a melody to – it’s whatever beat you want it to be
The beautiful singer who is currently expecting her first child with singer and hubby, Adekunle Gold, posted a totally adorable video of herself dancing to her new song, Duduke

Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit
When you do like that
You make me wan move right back
Why can't we move time back
Why can’t we do like that

If I was Moses I'll part seas and move mountains Your heart bleeds for a new accountant, coz it was stolen
I should've taken more care when I stepped up to be the one that you had chosen

I wish we could go back, but time doesn’t care about missed opportunities, or lies we both use
Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I’m falling

High for my baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit

I made mistakes, I can’t forget it
I felt your love, it's incandescence
Nothing’s changed except addresses
One song can't hold all my confessions

You might also like
But it's not enough though
We should have stayed exclusive like country club though
I held on to excuses, it's time to let go
Coz immature games are for old Nintendo’s
I
I had to realize sometimes falling is the biggest step that we ever take
All I need is a leap of faith


Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I'm falling

High on me baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit
When you do like that
You make me wan move right back
Why can't we move time back
Why can't we do like that


Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah

the song duduke is about “simi” unborn child that she can’t wait to see
“Duduke means – it’s the beat of your heart or the beat of the drums you move your body to, or the beat you sing a melody to – it’s whatever beat you want it to be
The beautiful singer who is currently expecting her first child with singer and hubby, Adekunle Gold, posted a totally adorable video of herself dancing to her new song, Duduke

Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit
When you do like that
You make me wan move right back
Why can't we move time back
Why can’t we do like that

If I was Moses I'll part seas and move mountains Your heart bleeds for a new accountant, coz it was stolen
I should've taken more care when I stepped up to be the one that you had chosen

I wish we could go back, but time doesn’t care about missed opportunities, or lies we both use
Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I’m falling

High for my baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit

I made mistakes, I can’t forget it
I felt your love, it's incandescence
Nothing’s changed except addresses
One song can't hold all my confessions

You might also like
But it's not enough though
We should have stayed exclusive like country club though
I held on to excuses, it's time to let go
Coz immature games are for old Nintendo’s
I
I had to realize sometimes falling is the biggest step that we ever take
All I need is a leap of faith


Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I'm falling

High on me baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit
When you do like that
You make me wan move right back
Why can't we move time back
Why can't we do like that


Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah

the song duduke is about “simi” unborn child that she can’t wait to see
“Duduke means – it’s the beat of your heart or the beat of the drums you move your body to, or the beat you sing a melody to – it’s whatever beat you want it to be
The beautiful singer who is currently expecting her first child with singer and hubby, Adekunle Gold, posted a totally adorable video of herself dancing to her new song, Duduke

Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit
When you do like that
You make me wan move right back
Why can't we move time back
Why can’t we do like that

If I was Moses I'll part seas and move mountains Your heart bleeds for a new accountant, coz it was stolen
I should've taken more care when I stepped up to be the one that you had chosen

I wish we could go back, but time doesn’t care about missed opportunities, or lies we both use
Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I’m falling

High for my baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit

I made mistakes, I can’t forget it
I felt your love, it's incandescence
Nothing’s changed except addresses
One song can't hold all my confessions

We should have stayed exclusive like country club though
I held on to excuses, it's time to let go
Coz immature games are for old Nintendo’s

I had to realize sometimes falling is the biggest step that we ever take
All I need is a leap of faith


Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I'm falling

High on me baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit
When you do like that
You make me wan move right back
Why can't we move time back
Why can't we do like that

the song duduke is about “simi” unborn child that she can’t wait to see
“Duduke means – it’s the beat of your heart or the beat of the drums you move your body to, or the beat you sing a melody to – it’s whatever beat you want it to be
The beautiful singer who is currently expecting her first child with singer and hubby, Adekunle Gold, posted a totally adorable video of herself dancing to her new song, Duduke

Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit
When you do like that
You make me wan move right back
Why can't we move time back
Why can’t we do like that

If I was Moses I'll part seas and move mountains Your heart bleeds for a new accountant, coz it was stolen
I should've taken more care when I stepped up to be the one that you had chosen

I wish we could go back, but time doesn’t care about missed opportunities, or lies we both use
Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I’m falling

High for my baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit

I made mistakes, I can’t forget it
I felt your love, it's incandescence
Nothing’s changed except addresses
One song can't hold all my confessions

All I need is a leap of faith


Save me when I'm falling

Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah

the song duduke is about “simi” unborn child that she can’t wait to see
“Duduke means – it’s the beat of your heart or the beat of the drums you move your body to, or the beat you sing a melody to – it’s whatever beat you want it to be
The beautiful singer who is currently expecting her first child with singer and hubby, Adekunle Gold, posted a totally adorable video of herself dancing to her new song, Duduke

When you do like that
You make me wan move right back
Why can't we move time back
Why can’t we do like that

If I was Moses I'll part seas and move mountains Your heart bleeds for a new accountant, coz it was stolen
I should've taken more care when I stepped up to be the one that you had chosen

I wish we could go back, but time doesn’t care about missed opportunities, or lies we both use
Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I’m falling

High for my baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit

I made mistakes, I can’t forget it
I felt your love, it's incandescence
Nothing’s changed except addresses
One song can't hold all my confessions

the song duduke is about “simi” unborn child that she can’t wait to see
“Duduke means – it’s the beat of your heart or the beat of the drums you move your body to, or the beat you sing a melody to – it’s whatever beat you want it to be
The beautiful singer who is currently expecting her first child with singer and hubby, Adekunle Gold, posted a totally adorable video of herself dancing to her new song, Duduke

When you do like that
You make me wan move right back
Why can't we move time back
Why can’t we do like that

If I was Moses I'll part seas and move mountains Your heart bleeds for a new accountant, coz it was stolen
I should've taken more care when I stepped up to be the one that you had chosen

I wish we could go back, but time doesn’t care about missed opportunities, or lies we both use
Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I’m falling

High for my baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit

I made mistakes, I can’t forget it
I felt your love, it's incandescence
Nothing’s changed except addresses
One song can't hold all my confessions

Come around my way

the song duduke is about “simi” unborn child that she can’t wait to see
“Duduke means – it’s the beat of your heart or the beat of the drums you move your body to, or the beat you sing a melody to – it’s whatever beat you want it to be
The beautiful singer who is currently expecting her first child with singer and hubby, Adekunle Gold, posted a totally adorable video of herself dancing to her new song, Duduke
