Say na me you go love forever

Oh my Angeli , Angelina

Anytime wey I see you for the club, I dey television your body
Shey you no know say the thing wey you carry fit kill somebody
You know I feel a vibe, you feel a vibe, so baby whine it pon me (ye!)
And I know you shy but it's cool when we're making love

[Chorus]
On the low
