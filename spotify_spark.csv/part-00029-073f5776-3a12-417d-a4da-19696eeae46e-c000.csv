In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

[Verse 2: Omah Lay]
Little love and some affection on the side
Little trust and some passion would be nice

Genius Annotation1 contributor
In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

Should I drink up? Smoke up?
Need some freedom, freedom, ah, in my life
Should I drink up? Smoke up?
Need some freedom, freedom

Show me a little attention (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
A little attention (Oh, oh)
Show me atten' (Oh, oh, mmm-mmm)
Show me a little attention, yeah, yeah (Oh, oh)
Show me a little attention

[Verse 2: Omah Lay]
Little love and some affection on the side
Little trust and some passion would be nice
It's all I desire
I need it, I cannot deny
Oh, ayy, I don't see something
For my ey–µs only
Ain't no emoji, cry him only, ah
Ain't no emoji, my mind's lonely

[Chorus: Omah Lay]
Show m–µ a little attention (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
A little attention (Oh, oh)
Show me attention (Oh, oh, mmm-mmm)
Show me a little attention, nah (Oh, oh)
Show me a little attention

[Bridge: Omah Lay]
Lately, I been losin' my mind
Certain things I can't find
In the middle of the night
I'm still up, I'm still tryna decide

Genius Annotation1 contributor
In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.
