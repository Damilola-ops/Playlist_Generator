I wish we could go back, but time doesn‚Äôt care about missed opportunities, or lies we both use
Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah

Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling

Why can‚Äôt we do like that

If I was Moses I'll part seas and move mountains Your heart bleeds for a new accountant, coz it was stolen
I should've taken more care when I stepped up to be the one that you had chosen

I wish we could go back, but time doesn‚Äôt care about missed opportunities, or lies we both use
Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I‚Äôm falling

High for my baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it

Nothing‚Äôs changed except addresses

Why can‚Äôt we do like that

If I was Moses I'll part seas and move mountains Your heart bleeds for a new accountant, coz it was stolen
I should've taken more care when I stepped up to be the one that you had chosen

I wish we could go back, but time doesn‚Äôt care about missed opportunities, or lies we both use
Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I‚Äôm falling

High for my baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it

Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more

Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah

Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more

If I was Moses I'll part seas and move mountains Your heart bleeds for a new accountant, coz it was stolen
I should've taken more care when I stepped up to be the one that you had chosen

I wish we could go back, but time doesn‚Äôt care about missed opportunities, or lies we both use
Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I‚Äôm falling

High for my baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit

I made mistakes, I can‚Äôt forget it
I felt your love, it's incandescence
Nothing‚Äôs changed except addresses
One song can't hold all my confessions

You might also like
But it's not enough though
We should have stayed exclusive like country club though
I held on to excuses, it's time to let go
Coz immature games are for old Nintendo‚Äôs
I
I had to realize sometimes falling is the biggest step that we ever take
All I need is a leap of faith


Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I'm falling

High on me baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit
When you do like that
You make me wan move right back
Why can't we move time back
Why can't we do like that


Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah

Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit
When you do like that
You make me wan move right back
Why can't we move time back
Why can‚Äôt we do like that

If I was Moses I'll part seas and move mountains Your heart bleeds for a new accountant, coz it was stolen
I should've taken more care when I stepped up to be the one that you had chosen

I wish we could go back, but time doesn‚Äôt care about missed opportunities, or lies we both use
Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I‚Äôm falling

High for my baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit

I made mistakes, I can‚Äôt forget it
I felt your love, it's incandescence
Nothing‚Äôs changed except addresses
One song can't hold all my confessions

But it's not enough though
We should have stayed exclusive like country club though
I held on to excuses, it's time to let go
Coz immature games are for old Nintendo‚Äôs

I had to realize sometimes falling is the biggest step that we ever take
All I need is a leap of faith


Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in

Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I'm falling

Why can‚Äôt we do like that

If I was Moses I'll part seas and move mountains Your heart bleeds for a new accountant, coz it was stolen
I should've taken more care when I stepped up to be the one that you had chosen

I wish we could go back, but time doesn‚Äôt care about missed opportunities, or lies we both use
Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart

My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I‚Äôm falling

High for my baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit

I made mistakes, I can‚Äôt forget it
I felt your love, it's incandescence
Nothing‚Äôs changed except addresses
One song can't hold all my confessions

All I need is a leap of faith

Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
