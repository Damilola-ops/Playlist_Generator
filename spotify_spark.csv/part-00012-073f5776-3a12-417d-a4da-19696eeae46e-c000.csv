‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

Plenty, plenty, plenty suffer wey we face
Just to make sure money dey

But my people dem go say
I no want kpai, I no want die
I no want kpeme, I want enjoy
I want chop life, I want buy motor
I want build house, I still want turn up

My nigga what's it gon' be
G-Wagon or de Bentley
The gyaldem riding with me
I no fit

[Verse 3]
Different things dem happening, schemes and packaging
In a one night, four shows, I'm juggling
Flow like the ocean, my boat I'm paddling
Shout out Shina Peller, that's my bro, my family
Frozen chains
When it comes to money, I dey concentrate
Make I tell you straight: You are not my mate
If you be commissioner, I be head of state

[Pre-Chorus]
But my people dem go say
I no want kpai, I no want die
I no want kpeme, I want enjoy
I want chop life, I want buy motor
I want build house, I still want turn up

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

You will be my royal highness
Out of all the girl them you are the flyest

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.
