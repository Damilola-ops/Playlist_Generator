In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

Genius Annotation1 contributor
In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.

In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn‚Äôt the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù alongside Alpha P in 2021.
