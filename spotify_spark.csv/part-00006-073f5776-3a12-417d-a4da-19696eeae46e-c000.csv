Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, my mind
Yeah, yeah, my mind

[Verse 1]
I said five in the morning
I wake up to fight for my earning
Fear in my mind is a warning
Pray to the one you rely in
I've been wandering all day
I try to be fine but I can't be
The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me
I try to get by but I'm burning

[Pre-Chorus]
And behind my mind it runs
All these thoughts of troubling
Fighting to give up my pain
Fighting to be on my lane
My mind running to the other side
When it's time to live my life
Then it tries to take mе out
Tell you what I need right here

[Chorus]
I rеally need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need mine now
I really need, I need to free my mind now
I really need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need mind now, uh, yeah

[Verse 2]
This is the peace that you cannot buy
Send me a love that you cannot mix
One is the joy that you cannot waste
And the other one price that you cannot fix
This is the peace that you cannot buy
Finding the way, when you cannot see
Man will desist if he cannot pray
I need to find release

Mmm, oh
Higher, higher
Saying higher-er-er-er, ayy

[Verse 1]
Tell me why you're crying now kini big deal
When you gave me something I don't really feel
But you knew that already
When I found you on the ground you were dying
Now why you come into my yard, uninvited?
Can you see me on the edge? I'm enlightened

[Chorus]
If the world was ending
Would you cry or would you try to get me?
Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah
Tell me now, I need you to be clеar, yeah
I will wait for you, for you
I will wait for you, I will wait for you

[Verse 2]
Get me, can you put thе time on a rewind, yeah
Help me understand, can you tell me now
Why you made the war that we're fighting now
And you fall and you run when you see my big guns
Run around, run away as the rebel comes out
Then you call, call on me when you call me I come
But there you go again

Running away to the land of discovery
Running away from the suffering, I'm gone, yeah
Running away from the darkness, I'm out here, yeah

[Chorus]
Higher than all the limits
Going way beyond the noise and your feelings
When you speak all I can hear is silence
Running back from all the pain and violence
Big tunes, now it's big tunes I'm killing
Cry now from the side now, call my name
Fall down when you see me, you know that
You know that I will stay for you
I will wait for you, for you
I will wait for you, I will wait for you

People always try to get involved
I feel like I'm dumb, I don't know where to run
People always trying to take a bite out of my mind
If you need a fight, maybe we could start
I feel I might just be coming undone
Tell me why you can't be found?
It's so unreasonable, I know you
Love is a difficult life
Maybe we should take it to the streets

[Pre-Chorus: Tems]
Basically, I might not be weak
Basically, I might not be falling
Basically, I might be used to this

Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2: Brent Faiyaz, Tems, Both]
Before this gets out of hand
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my mannеrs (I'll do)
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that
Can you picturе that? Yeah
I don't know who you been dealing with, but I–
Guarantee that you ain't been with this, because–
If you had you'll forget about the past
Before this gets out of hand (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my manners
Won't take advantage

I was in LA with Brent; he is such an amazing artist. He always knows how to bring a different perspective. The song is really about releasing different thoughts in my head and reconciling them with my truth.

One time you tell me one chance

Yeah-yeah, yeah, no, woah, oh, oh-oh
Yeah-yeah, yeah, mm
Mm, mm-hmm, mm

[Verse 1]
Oh, my voice is a mystery
But they always tryna diss me
Same guys tryna get in my way
Keep the same vibe, you can't ruin my day
Oh, my voice is a mystery
Ride the wave of my history
I've been distant to keep my distance
Goodbye to a boring life
I like to seek but I'm never in sight
Even though I'm the type to ride
I like to care but e never reach fight
Swinging my waist like you never did see
And then I roll like I really get baked
And you can't believe what you heard me about me
It's the magic for me
They keep trying to reach me, yeah, yeah
It's the magic for me
I make them weep 'til they run insane
So get me lit on a weekday
I'm on the way and my ways on a display
And I'ma shut 'em all down one of these days
It's my time so put me on a replay

[Bridge]
Who this guy that they say they wan try me?
Who this guy and they say they wan play me?
Who this guy that they say they wan break?
Who this guy that they say they wan shake?
All this time that they wan break, yeah
All this time that them think they wan take, yeah
Who this guy that he say wan pie me?
Who this guy that he say he wan define me?
I've been 'round the world, nah, nah, nah
And when they call, boy, nah me they call (Oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh, ah)

[Verse 2]
Back then when I ain't have no friends
And yah condescend but I really won't rest see
Even though bro, I could let you go
But I really wan show that you really can't test me
Even on days, when they tried to arrest me
But if you live a lie, there's no way you could get me
Pissed em off, they locked me up in a celly
Then e shock dem when they see me on the telly
You know, I'm a vibe and I run it as usual
I didn't only come around just to make it
And I could shake things but I'll break it
You name it boy
Who knew I won't care for the things that you do?
I could turn let everyone try me
'Cause you never gonna get what is for me
Yeah-uh

No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have and good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

[Chorus]
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light, as it was
A log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
No, I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

What you want? Rosè? Champagne?
I got that, big bag, back pain
Taking the piss, the only time I can't aim
So we toast to the good life
Living every minute to the full cause I could die
Pull up at the spot open doors and it's suicide
Chilling rent free

Ladipoe, Fireboy and Vibez man
Here's another story from a bad man
Vibez
But you knew that

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Verse 1: Ladipoe]
Even though the country don dey tire me
I dey catch cruise, Eko Miami
If only bad news could be bribed, take all my money
I like my lies sweet, tastes like irony
But that's the reason, I dey vеx my nigga
Heavy is the head but forgеt my nigga
Crown don dey bend from the stress my nigga
It's getting hard to suppress my liquor
So I'm drinking more wine at four thirty
I'd rather be online than out with company
Man I'm tryna numb my mind, the thoughts are too heavy
'Cause life is no joke we cope with comedy
I really no dey see your face
That's why we switch lanes, no dey indicate
Everybody wan blow, who dey pick the date?
God when will I be the one that they imitate
But most times I feel no one can relate

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
When there's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

What's a vaccine to an antidote
Blood, sweat, tears in my engine o
If you smell success that's my cologne
Broke almost every code
Still I got fans filling every row
This anointing from the microphone
And that's on God, only heaven knows

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Outro: Ladipoe]
I've been running for life
Pastor said I've been running from life
Tank on E I'm just running on vibes
Sweet white wine with some Henny combined
Let me unwind
Coz it's heavy all night
I don't want any on mine
You can unfriend me online
I'm just running, running running on vibes
Yeah, but you knew that
It's Ladipoe

Tell you what I need right here

Now why you come into my yard, uninvited?
Can you see me on the edge? I'm enlightened

Would you cry or would you try to get me?

People always try to get involved
I feel like I'm dumb, I don't know where to run
People always trying to take a bite out of my mind
If you need a fight, maybe we could start
I feel I might just be coming undone
Tell me why you can't be found?
It's so unreasonable, I know you
Love is a difficult life
Maybe we should take it to the streets

[Pre-Chorus: Tems]
Basically, I might not be weak
Basically, I might not be falling
Basically, I might be used to this

Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2: Brent Faiyaz, Tems, Both]
Before this gets out of hand
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my mannеrs (I'll do)
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that
Can you picturе that? Yeah
I don't know who you been dealing with, but I–
Guarantee that you ain't been with this, because–
If you had you'll forget about the past
Before this gets out of hand (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my manners
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

I was in LA with Brent; he is such an amazing artist. He always knows how to bring a different perspective. The song is really about releasing different thoughts in my head and reconciling them with my truth.

Mm, mm-hmm, mm

[Verse 1]
Oh, my voice is a mystery
But they always tryna diss me
Same guys tryna get in my way
Keep the same vibe, you can't ruin my day
Oh, my voice is a mystery
Ride the wave of my history
I've been distant to keep my distance
Goodbye to a boring life
I like to seek but I'm never in sight
Even though I'm the type to ride
I like to care but e never reach fight
Swinging my waist like you never did see
And then I roll like I really get baked
And you can't believe what you heard me about me
It's the magic for me
They keep trying to reach me, yeah, yeah
It's the magic for me
I make them weep 'til they run insane
So get me lit on a weekday
I'm on the way and my ways on a display
And I'ma shut 'em all down one of these days
It's my time so put me on a replay

[Bridge]
Who this guy that they say they wan try me?
Who this guy and they say they wan play me?
Who this guy that they say they wan break?
Who this guy that they say they wan shake?
All this time that they wan break, yeah
All this time that them think they wan take, yeah
Who this guy that he say wan pie me?
Who this guy that he say he wan define me?
I've been 'round the world, nah, nah, nah
And when they call, boy, nah me they call (Oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh, ah)

[Verse 2]
Back then when I ain't have no friends
And yah condescend but I really won't rest see
Even though bro, I could let you go
But I really wan show that you really can't test me
Even on days, when they tried to arrest me
But if you live a lie, there's no way you could get me
Pissed em off, they locked me up in a celly
Then e shock dem when they see me on the telly
You know, I'm a vibe and I run it as usual
I didn't only come around just to make it
And I could shake things but I'll break it
You name it boy
Who knew I won't care for the things that you do?
I could turn let everyone try me
'Cause you never gonna get what is for me
Yeah-uh

No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have and good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

[Chorus]
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light, as it was
A log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
No, I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

Omo e get small thing wey dey stress me
But right now I'm chilling now
Oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1: Ladipoe]
Way out my feelings and nothing can stress me
The way I run the game I'm feeling like referee
No like Moses parting the red sea
Like a chaffeur, me in the back of Bentley
So I step out all white can’t stain
What you want? Rosè? Champagne?
I got that, big bag, back pain
Taking the piss, the only time I can't aim
So we toast to the good life
Living every minute to the full cause I could die
Pull up at the spot open doors and it's suicide
Chilling rent free
Where the check please? Couple hundred Gs on a good night

[Chorus: Buju]
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae
Spoil my blues and rhythm now
Oh oh oh oh
I like the way I'm feeling now

Ladipoe, Fireboy and Vibez man
Here's another story from a bad man
Vibez
But you knew that

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Verse 1: Ladipoe]
Even though the country don dey tire me
I dey catch cruise, Eko Miami
If only bad news could be bribed, take all my money
I like my lies sweet, tastes like irony
But that's the reason, I dey vеx my nigga
Heavy is the head but forgеt my nigga
Crown don dey bend from the stress my nigga
It's getting hard to suppress my liquor
So I'm drinking more wine at four thirty
I'd rather be online than out with company
Man I'm tryna numb my mind, the thoughts are too heavy
'Cause life is no joke we cope with comedy
I really no dey see your face
That's why we switch lanes, no dey indicate
Everybody wan blow, who dey pick the date?
God when will I be the one that they imitate
But most times I feel no one can relate

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
When there's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

Galloping like I'm an antelope

Lone soldier me I dey stand alone
Me I dey fight for my envelope
But me I no fit to dey fight alone
Ou ha

[Verse 3: Ladipoe]
And you don't have to bro
What's a vaccine to an antidote
Blood, sweat, tears in my engine o
If you smell success that's my cologne
Broke almost every code
Still I got fans filling every row
This anointing from the microphone
And that's on God, only heaven knows

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Outro: Ladipoe]
I've been running for life
Pastor said I've been running from life
Tank on E I'm just running on vibes
Sweet white wine with some Henny combined
Let me unwind
Coz it's heavy all night
I don't want any on mine
You can unfriend me online
I'm just running, running running on vibes
Yeah, but you knew that
It's Ladipoe

I said five in the morning
I wake up to fight for my earning
Fear in my mind is a warning
Pray to the one you rely in
I've been wandering all day
I try to be fine but I can't be
The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me
I try to get by but I'm burning

[Pre-Chorus]
And behind my mind it runs
All these thoughts of troubling
Fighting to give up my pain
Fighting to be on my lane
My mind running to the other side
When it's time to live my life
Then it tries to take mе out
Tell you what I need right here

[Chorus]
I rеally need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need mine now
I really need, I need to free my mind now
I really need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need mind now, uh, yeah

[Verse 2]
This is the peace that you cannot buy
Send me a love that you cannot mix
One is the joy that you cannot waste
And the other one price that you cannot fix
This is the peace that you cannot buy
Finding the way, when you cannot see
Man will desist if he cannot pray

Now why you come into my yard, uninvited?
Can you see me on the edge? I'm enlightened

Would you cry or would you try to get me?

Running away from the suffering, I'm gone, yeah
Running away from the darkness, I'm out here, yeah

Going way beyond the noise and your feelings
When you speak all I can hear is silence

People always try to get involved
I feel like I'm dumb, I don't know where to run
People always trying to take a bite out of my mind
If you need a fight, maybe we could start
I feel I might just be coming undone
Tell me why you can't be found?
It's so unreasonable, I know you
Love is a difficult life
Maybe we should take it to the streets

[Pre-Chorus: Tems]
Basically, I might not be weak
Basically, I might not be falling
Basically, I might be used to this

Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found

Before this gets out of hand
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my mannеrs (I'll do)
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that
Can you picturе that? Yeah
I don't know who you been dealing with, but I–
Guarantee that you ain't been with this, because–
If you had you'll forget about the past
Before this gets out of hand (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my manners
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

I was in LA with Brent; he is such an amazing artist. He always knows how to bring a different perspective. The song is really about releasing different thoughts in my head and reconciling them with my truth.

Back then when I was a new youngin
Surely you were tryna run on me
I've been, I've been going on my own
I've been, I've been doing things unknown
Since day one you running right back
Save the drama you running off track
Is a one life, you tell me one life
One time you tell me one chance

[Pre-Chorus]
Open your eyes, open your eyes, babe
Can you be wise
'Cause you'rе my pride, babe
I'm on the way, I'm on thе run, babe
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Take it back now
I put you on there
Say you wan chance to hold it on me
I finna hold it back
Turn you right round
Taking my way

Yeah-yeah, yeah, no, woah, oh, oh-oh
Yeah-yeah, yeah, mm
Mm, mm-hmm, mm

[Verse 1]
Oh, my voice is a mystery
But they always tryna diss me
Same guys tryna get in my way
Keep the same vibe, you can't ruin my day
Oh, my voice is a mystery
Ride the wave of my history
I've been distant to keep my distance
Goodbye to a boring life
I like to seek but I'm never in sight
Even though I'm the type to ride
I like to care but e never reach fight
Swinging my waist like you never did see
And then I roll like I really get baked
And you can't believe what you heard me about me
It's the magic for me
They keep trying to reach me, yeah, yeah
It's the magic for me
I make them weep 'til they run insane
So get me lit on a weekday
I'm on the way and my ways on a display
And I'ma shut 'em all down one of these days
It's my time so put me on a replay

[Bridge]
Who this guy that they say they wan try me?
Who this guy and they say they wan play me?
Who this guy that they say they wan break?
Who this guy that they say they wan shake?
All this time that they wan break, yeah
All this time that them think they wan take, yeah
Who this guy that he say wan pie me?
Who this guy that he say he wan define me?
I've been 'round the world, nah, nah, nah
And when they call, boy, nah me they call (Oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh, ah)

[Verse 2]
Back then when I ain't have no friends
And yah condescend but I really won't rest see
Even though bro, I could let you go
But I really wan show that you really can't test me
Even on days, when they tried to arrest me
But if you live a lie, there's no way you could get me
Pissed em off, they locked me up in a celly
Then e shock dem when they see me on the telly
You know, I'm a vibe and I run it as usual
I didn't only come around just to make it
And I could shake things but I'll break it
You name it boy
Who knew I won't care for the things that you do?
I could turn let everyone try me
'Cause you never gonna get what is for me
Yeah-uh

No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have and good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

[Chorus]
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light, as it was
A log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
No, I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

[Verse 1: Ladipoe]
Way out my feelings and nothing can stress me
The way I run the game I'm feeling like referee
No like Moses parting the red sea
Like a chaffeur, me in the back of Bentley
So I step out all white can’t stain
What you want? Rosè? Champagne?
I got that, big bag, back pain
Taking the piss, the only time I can't aim
So we toast to the good life
Living every minute to the full cause I could die
Pull up at the spot open doors and it's suicide
Chilling rent free
Where the check please? Couple hundred Gs on a good night

[Chorus: Buju]
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae
Spoil my blues and rhythm now
Oh oh oh oh
I like the way I'm feeling now

Ladipoe, Fireboy and Vibez man
Here's another story from a bad man
Vibez
But you knew that

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Verse 1: Ladipoe]
Even though the country don dey tire me
I dey catch cruise, Eko Miami
If only bad news could be bribed, take all my money
I like my lies sweet, tastes like irony
But that's the reason, I dey vеx my nigga
Heavy is the head but forgеt my nigga
Crown don dey bend from the stress my nigga
It's getting hard to suppress my liquor
So I'm drinking more wine at four thirty
I'd rather be online than out with company
Man I'm tryna numb my mind, the thoughts are too heavy
'Cause life is no joke we cope with comedy
I really no dey see your face
That's why we switch lanes, no dey indicate
Everybody wan blow, who dey pick the date?
God when will I be the one that they imitate
But most times I feel no one can relate

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
When there's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

Lone soldier me I dey stand alone
Me I dey fight for my envelope
But me I no fit to dey fight alone
Ou ha

[Verse 3: Ladipoe]
And you don't have to bro
What's a vaccine to an antidote
Blood, sweat, tears in my engine o
If you smell success that's my cologne
Broke almost every code
Still I got fans filling every row
This anointing from the microphone
And that's on God, only heaven knows

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Outro: Ladipoe]
I've been running for life
Pastor said I've been running from life
Tank on E I'm just running on vibes
Sweet white wine with some Henny combined
Let me unwind
Coz it's heavy all night
I don't want any on mine
You can unfriend me online
I'm just running, running running on vibes
Yeah, but you knew that
It's Ladipoe

Mmm, oh
Higher, higher
Saying higher-er-er-er, ayy

[Verse 1]
Tell me why you're crying now kini big deal
When you gave me something I don't really feel
But you knew that already
When I found you on the ground you were dying
Now why you come into my yard, uninvited?
Can you see me on the edge? I'm enlightened

[Chorus]
If the world was ending
Would you cry or would you try to get me?
Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah
Tell me now, I need you to be clеar, yeah
I will wait for you, for you
I will wait for you, I will wait for you

[Verse 2]
Get me, can you put thе time on a rewind, yeah
Help me understand, can you tell me now
Why you made the war that we're fighting now
And you fall and you run when you see my big guns
Run around, run away as the rebel comes out
Then you call, call on me when you call me I come
But there you go again

[Verse 3]
With your deaf ears
Open your mind to the sound of the trumpet
What do you want from a life of the hopeless
Now here you are, you're begging and crying
I want to fly, yeah, I'm flying till morning
Running away to the land of discovery
Running away from the suffering, I'm gone, yeah
Running away from the darkness, I'm out here, yeah

[Chorus]
Higher than all the limits
Going way beyond the noise and your feelings
When you speak all I can hear is silence
Running back from all the pain and violence
Big tunes, now it's big tunes I'm killing
Cry now from the side now, call my name
Fall down when you see me, you know that
You know that I will stay for you
I will wait for you, for you
I will wait for you, I will wait for you

People always try to get involved
I feel like I'm dumb, I don't know where to run
People always trying to take a bite out of my mind
If you need a fight, maybe we could start
I feel I might just be coming undone
Tell me why you can't be found?
It's so unreasonable, I know you
Love is a difficult life
Maybe we should take it to the streets

[Pre-Chorus: Tems]
Basically, I might not be weak
Basically, I might not be falling
Basically, I might be used to this

[Chorus: Tems]
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2: Brent Faiyaz, Tems, Both]
Before this gets out of hand
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my mannеrs (I'll do)
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that
Can you picturе that? Yeah
I don't know who you been dealing with, but I–
Guarantee that you ain't been with this, because–
If you had you'll forget about the past
Before this gets out of hand (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my manners
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

What have the artists said about the song?
Genius Answer1 contributor
I was in LA with Brent; he is such an amazing artist. He always knows how to bring a different perspective. The song is really about releasing different thoughts in my head and reconciling them with my truth.

One time you tell me one chance

Yeah-yeah, yeah, no, woah, oh, oh-oh
Yeah-yeah, yeah, mm
Mm, mm-hmm, mm

[Verse 1]
Oh, my voice is a mystery
But they always tryna diss me
Same guys tryna get in my way
Keep the same vibe, you can't ruin my day
Oh, my voice is a mystery
Ride the wave of my history
I've been distant to keep my distance
Goodbye to a boring life
I like to seek but I'm never in sight
Even though I'm the type to ride
I like to care but e never reach fight
Swinging my waist like you never did see
And then I roll like I really get baked
And you can't believe what you heard me about me
It's the magic for me
They keep trying to reach me, yeah, yeah
It's the magic for me
I make them weep 'til they run insane
So get me lit on a weekday
I'm on the way and my ways on a display
And I'ma shut 'em all down one of these days
It's my time so put me on a replay

[Bridge]
Who this guy that they say they wan try me?
Who this guy and they say they wan play me?
Who this guy that they say they wan break?
Who this guy that they say they wan shake?
All this time that they wan break, yeah
All this time that them think they wan take, yeah
Who this guy that he say wan pie me?
Who this guy that he say he wan define me?
I've been 'round the world, nah, nah, nah
And when they call, boy, nah me they call (Oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh, ah)

[Verse 2]
Back then when I ain't have no friends
And yah condescend but I really won't rest see
Even though bro, I could let you go
But I really wan show that you really can't test me
Even on days, when they tried to arrest me
But if you live a lie, there's no way you could get me
Pissed em off, they locked me up in a celly
Then e shock dem when they see me on the telly
You know, I'm a vibe and I run it as usual
I didn't only come around just to make it
And I could shake things but I'll break it
You name it boy
Who knew I won't care for the things that you do?
I could turn let everyone try me
'Cause you never gonna get what is for me
Yeah-uh

No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have and good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

[Chorus]
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light, as it was
A log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
No, I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

No like Moses parting the red sea
Like a chaffeur, me in the back of Bentley
So I step out all white can’t stain
What you want? Rosè? Champagne?
I got that, big bag, back pain
Taking the piss, the only time I can't aim
So we toast to the good life
Living every minute to the full cause I could die
Pull up at the spot open doors and it's suicide
Chilling rent free
Where the check please? Couple hundred Gs on a good night

Ladipoe, Fireboy and Vibez man
Here's another story from a bad man
Vibez
But you knew that

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Verse 1: Ladipoe]
Even though the country don dey tire me
I dey catch cruise, Eko Miami
If only bad news could be bribed, take all my money
I like my lies sweet, tastes like irony
But that's the reason, I dey vеx my nigga
Heavy is the head but forgеt my nigga
Crown don dey bend from the stress my nigga
It's getting hard to suppress my liquor
So I'm drinking more wine at four thirty
I'd rather be online than out with company
Man I'm tryna numb my mind, the thoughts are too heavy
'Cause life is no joke we cope with comedy
I really no dey see your face
That's why we switch lanes, no dey indicate
Everybody wan blow, who dey pick the date?
God when will I be the one that they imitate
But most times I feel no one can relate

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
When there's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

Lone soldier me I dey stand alone
Me I dey fight for my envelope
But me I no fit to dey fight alone
Ou ha

[Verse 3: Ladipoe]
And you don't have to bro
What's a vaccine to an antidote
Blood, sweat, tears in my engine o
If you smell success that's my cologne
Broke almost every code
Still I got fans filling every row
This anointing from the microphone
And that's on God, only heaven knows

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Outro: Ladipoe]
I've been running for life
Pastor said I've been running from life
Tank on E I'm just running on vibes
Sweet white wine with some Henny combined
Let me unwind
Coz it's heavy all night
I don't want any on mine
You can unfriend me online
I'm just running, running running on vibes
Yeah, but you knew that
It's Ladipoe

The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me
I try to get by but I'm burning

All these thoughts of troubling
Fighting to give up my pain
Fighting to be on my lane
My mind running to the other side
When it's time to live my life
Then it tries to take mе out
Tell you what I need right here

[Verse 2]
This is the peace that you cannot buy
Send me a love that you cannot mix

And the other one price that you cannot fix
This is the peace that you cannot buy
Finding the way, when you cannot see
Man will desist if he cannot pray

Tell me why you're crying now kini big deal

When I found you on the ground you were dying
Now why you come into my yard, uninvited?
Can you see me on the edge? I'm enlightened

If the world was ending
Would you cry or would you try to get me?

People always try to get involved
I feel like I'm dumb, I don't know where to run
People always trying to take a bite out of my mind
If you need a fight, maybe we could start
I feel I might just be coming undone
Tell me why you can't be found?
It's so unreasonable, I know you
Love is a difficult life
Maybe we should take it to the streets

[Pre-Chorus: Tems]
Basically, I might not be weak
Basically, I might not be falling
Basically, I might be used to this

[Chorus: Tems]
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2: Brent Faiyaz, Tems, Both]
Before this gets out of hand
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my mannеrs (I'll do)
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that
Can you picturе that? Yeah
I don't know who you been dealing with, but I–
Guarantee that you ain't been with this, because–
If you had you'll forget about the past
Before this gets out of hand (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my manners
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

I was in LA with Brent; he is such an amazing artist. He always knows how to bring a different perspective. The song is really about releasing different thoughts in my head and reconciling them with my truth.

One time you tell me one chance

Open your eyes, open your eyes, babe
Can you be wise
'Cause you'rе my pride, babe

Yeah-yeah, yeah, mm
Mm, mm-hmm, mm

[Verse 1]
Oh, my voice is a mystery
But they always tryna diss me
Same guys tryna get in my way
Keep the same vibe, you can't ruin my day
Oh, my voice is a mystery
Ride the wave of my history
I've been distant to keep my distance
Goodbye to a boring life
I like to seek but I'm never in sight
Even though I'm the type to ride
I like to care but e never reach fight
Swinging my waist like you never did see
And then I roll like I really get baked
And you can't believe what you heard me about me
It's the magic for me
They keep trying to reach me, yeah, yeah
It's the magic for me
I make them weep 'til they run insane
So get me lit on a weekday
I'm on the way and my ways on a display
And I'ma shut 'em all down one of these days
It's my time so put me on a replay

[Bridge]
Who this guy that they say they wan try me?
Who this guy and they say they wan play me?
Who this guy that they say they wan break?
Who this guy that they say they wan shake?
All this time that they wan break, yeah
All this time that them think they wan take, yeah
Who this guy that he say wan pie me?
Who this guy that he say he wan define me?
I've been 'round the world, nah, nah, nah
And when they call, boy, nah me they call (Oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh, ah)

[Verse 2]
Back then when I ain't have no friends
And yah condescend but I really won't rest see
Even though bro, I could let you go
But I really wan show that you really can't test me
Even on days, when they tried to arrest me
But if you live a lie, there's no way you could get me
Pissed em off, they locked me up in a celly
Then e shock dem when they see me on the telly
You know, I'm a vibe and I run it as usual
I didn't only come around just to make it
And I could shake things but I'll break it
You name it boy
Who knew I won't care for the things that you do?
I could turn let everyone try me
'Cause you never gonna get what is for me
Yeah-uh

No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have and good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

[Chorus]
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light, as it was
A log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
No, I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

[Chorus: Buju]

[Verse 1: Ladipoe]
Way out my feelings and nothing can stress me
The way I run the game I'm feeling like referee
No like Moses parting the red sea
Like a chaffeur, me in the back of Bentley
So I step out all white can’t stain
What you want? Rosè? Champagne?
I got that, big bag, back pain
Taking the piss, the only time I can't aim
So we toast to the good life
Living every minute to the full cause I could die
Pull up at the spot open doors and it's suicide
Chilling rent free
Where the check please? Couple hundred Gs on a good night

[Chorus: Buju]
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae
Spoil my blues and rhythm now
Oh oh oh oh
I like the way I'm feeling now

Ladipoe, Fireboy and Vibez man
Here's another story from a bad man
Vibez
But you knew that

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Verse 1: Ladipoe]
Even though the country don dey tire me
I dey catch cruise, Eko Miami
If only bad news could be bribed, take all my money
I like my lies sweet, tastes like irony
But that's the reason, I dey vеx my nigga
Heavy is the head but forgеt my nigga
Crown don dey bend from the stress my nigga
It's getting hard to suppress my liquor
So I'm drinking more wine at four thirty
I'd rather be online than out with company
Man I'm tryna numb my mind, the thoughts are too heavy
'Cause life is no joke we cope with comedy
I really no dey see your face
That's why we switch lanes, no dey indicate
Everybody wan blow, who dey pick the date?
God when will I be the one that they imitate
But most times I feel no one can relate

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
When there's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

Galloping like I'm an antelope
Ou ha

Lone soldier me I dey stand alone
Me I dey fight for my envelope
But me I no fit to dey fight alone
Ou ha

[Verse 3: Ladipoe]
And you don't have to bro
What's a vaccine to an antidote
Blood, sweat, tears in my engine o
If you smell success that's my cologne
Broke almost every code
Still I got fans filling every row
This anointing from the microphone
And that's on God, only heaven knows

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Outro: Ladipoe]
I've been running for life
Pastor said I've been running from life
Tank on E I'm just running on vibes
Sweet white wine with some Henny combined
Let me unwind
Coz it's heavy all night
I don't want any on mine
You can unfriend me online
I'm just running, running running on vibes
Yeah, but you knew that
It's Ladipoe

Fear in my mind is a warning
Pray to the one you rely in

I try to be fine but I can't be
The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me
I try to get by but I'm burning

And behind my mind it runs
All these thoughts of troubling
Fighting to give up my pain
Fighting to be on my lane
My mind running to the other side
When it's time to live my life
Then it tries to take mе out
Tell you what I need right here

Send me a love that you cannot mix

And the other one price that you cannot fix
This is the peace that you cannot buy
Finding the way, when you cannot see

It's so unreasonable, I know you
Love is a difficult life
Maybe we should take it to the streets

I was in LA with Brent; he is such an amazing artist. He always knows how to bring a different perspective. The song is really about releasing different thoughts in my head and reconciling them with my truth.

Yeah-yeah, yeah, no, woah, oh, oh-oh
Yeah-yeah, yeah, mm
Mm, mm-hmm, mm

[Verse 1]
Oh, my voice is a mystery
But they always tryna diss me
Same guys tryna get in my way
Keep the same vibe, you can't ruin my day
Oh, my voice is a mystery
Ride the wave of my history
I've been distant to keep my distance
Goodbye to a boring life
I like to seek but I'm never in sight
Even though I'm the type to ride
I like to care but e never reach fight
Swinging my waist like you never did see
And then I roll like I really get baked
And you can't believe what you heard me about me
It's the magic for me
They keep trying to reach me, yeah, yeah
It's the magic for me
I make them weep 'til they run insane
So get me lit on a weekday
I'm on the way and my ways on a display
And I'ma shut 'em all down one of these days
It's my time so put me on a replay

[Bridge]
Who this guy that they say they wan try me?
Who this guy and they say they wan play me?
Who this guy that they say they wan break?
Who this guy that they say they wan shake?
All this time that they wan break, yeah
All this time that them think they wan take, yeah
Who this guy that he say wan pie me?
Who this guy that he say he wan define me?
I've been 'round the world, nah, nah, nah
And when they call, boy, nah me they call (Oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh, ah)

[Verse 2]
Back then when I ain't have no friends
And yah condescend but I really won't rest see
Even though bro, I could let you go
But I really wan show that you really can't test me
Even on days, when they tried to arrest me
But if you live a lie, there's no way you could get me
Pissed em off, they locked me up in a celly
Then e shock dem when they see me on the telly
You know, I'm a vibe and I run it as usual
I didn't only come around just to make it
And I could shake things but I'll break it
You name it boy
Who knew I won't care for the things that you do?
I could turn let everyone try me
'Cause you never gonna get what is for me
Yeah-uh

No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have and good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

[Chorus]
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light, as it was
A log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
No, I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

Way out my feelings and nothing can stress me
The way I run the game I'm feeling like referee
No like Moses parting the red sea
Like a chaffeur, me in the back of Bentley
So I step out all white can’t stain
What you want? Rosè? Champagne?
I got that, big bag, back pain
Taking the piss, the only time I can't aim
So we toast to the good life
Living every minute to the full cause I could die
Pull up at the spot open doors and it's suicide
Chilling rent free
Where the check please? Couple hundred Gs on a good night

[Chorus: Buju]
I like the way I'm feeling now

Ladipoe, Fireboy and Vibez man
Here's another story from a bad man
Vibez
But you knew that

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Verse 1: Ladipoe]
Even though the country don dey tire me
I dey catch cruise, Eko Miami
If only bad news could be bribed, take all my money
I like my lies sweet, tastes like irony
But that's the reason, I dey vеx my nigga
Heavy is the head but forgеt my nigga
Crown don dey bend from the stress my nigga
It's getting hard to suppress my liquor
So I'm drinking more wine at four thirty
I'd rather be online than out with company
Man I'm tryna numb my mind, the thoughts are too heavy
'Cause life is no joke we cope with comedy
I really no dey see your face
That's why we switch lanes, no dey indicate
Everybody wan blow, who dey pick the date?
God when will I be the one that they imitate
But most times I feel no one can relate

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
When there's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

Galloping like I'm an antelope
Ou ha
I took it personal
Lone soldier me I dey stand alone
Me I dey fight for my envelope
But me I no fit to dey fight alone
Ou ha

[Verse 3: Ladipoe]
And you don't have to bro
What's a vaccine to an antidote
Blood, sweat, tears in my engine o
If you smell success that's my cologne
Broke almost every code
Still I got fans filling every row
This anointing from the microphone
And that's on God, only heaven knows

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Outro: Ladipoe]
I've been running for life
Pastor said I've been running from life
Tank on E I'm just running on vibes
Sweet white wine with some Henny combined
Let me unwind
Coz it's heavy all night
I don't want any on mine
You can unfriend me online
I'm just running, running running on vibes
Yeah, but you knew that
It's Ladipoe

Running away from the suffering, I'm gone, yeah
Running away from the darkness, I'm out here, yeah

[Chorus]
Higher than all the limits
Going way beyond the noise and your feelings
When you speak all I can hear is silence
Running back from all the pain and violence
Big tunes, now it's big tunes I'm killing
Cry now from the side now, call my name
Fall down when you see me, you know that
You know that I will stay for you
I will wait for you, for you
I will wait for you, I will wait for you

People always try to get involved
I feel like I'm dumb, I don't know where to run
People always trying to take a bite out of my mind
If you need a fight, maybe we could start
I feel I might just be coming undone
Tell me why you can't be found?
It's so unreasonable, I know you
Love is a difficult life
Maybe we should take it to the streets

[Pre-Chorus: Tems]
Basically, I might not be weak
Basically, I might not be falling
Basically, I might be used to this

[Chorus: Tems]
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2: Brent Faiyaz, Tems, Both]
Before this gets out of hand
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my mannеrs (I'll do)
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that
Can you picturе that? Yeah
I don't know who you been dealing with, but I–
Guarantee that you ain't been with this, because–
If you had you'll forget about the past
Before this gets out of hand (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my manners
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Can you picture that?

What have the artists said about the song?
Genius Answer1 contributor
I was in LA with Brent; he is such an amazing artist. He always knows how to bring a different perspective. The song is really about releasing different thoughts in my head and reconciling them with my truth.

One time you tell me one chance

Yeah-yeah, yeah, no, woah, oh, oh-oh
Yeah-yeah, yeah, mm
Mm, mm-hmm, mm

[Verse 1]
Oh, my voice is a mystery
But they always tryna diss me
Same guys tryna get in my way
Keep the same vibe, you can't ruin my day
Oh, my voice is a mystery
Ride the wave of my history
I've been distant to keep my distance
Goodbye to a boring life
I like to seek but I'm never in sight
Even though I'm the type to ride
I like to care but e never reach fight
Swinging my waist like you never did see
And then I roll like I really get baked
And you can't believe what you heard me about me
It's the magic for me
They keep trying to reach me, yeah, yeah
It's the magic for me
I make them weep 'til they run insane
So get me lit on a weekday
I'm on the way and my ways on a display
And I'ma shut 'em all down one of these days
It's my time so put me on a replay

[Bridge]
Who this guy that they say they wan try me?
Who this guy and they say they wan play me?
Who this guy that they say they wan break?
Who this guy that they say they wan shake?
All this time that they wan break, yeah
All this time that them think they wan take, yeah
Who this guy that he say wan pie me?
Who this guy that he say he wan define me?
I've been 'round the world, nah, nah, nah
And when they call, boy, nah me they call (Oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh, ah)

[Verse 2]
Back then when I ain't have no friends
And yah condescend but I really won't rest see
Even though bro, I could let you go
But I really wan show that you really can't test me
Even on days, when they tried to arrest me
But if you live a lie, there's no way you could get me
Pissed em off, they locked me up in a celly
Then e shock dem when they see me on the telly
You know, I'm a vibe and I run it as usual
I didn't only come around just to make it
And I could shake things but I'll break it
You name it boy
Who knew I won't care for the things that you do?
I could turn let everyone try me
'Cause you never gonna get what is for me
Yeah-uh

No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have and good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

[Chorus]
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light, as it was
A log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
No, I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

No like Moses parting the red sea
Like a chaffeur, me in the back of Bentley
So I step out all white can’t stain
What you want? Rosè? Champagne?
I got that, big bag, back pain
Taking the piss, the only time I can't aim
So we toast to the good life
Living every minute to the full cause I could die
Pull up at the spot open doors and it's suicide
Chilling rent free
Where the check please? Couple hundred Gs on a good night

Ladipoe, Fireboy and Vibez man
Here's another story from a bad man
Vibez
But you knew that

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Verse 1: Ladipoe]
Even though the country don dey tire me
I dey catch cruise, Eko Miami
If only bad news could be bribed, take all my money
I like my lies sweet, tastes like irony
But that's the reason, I dey vеx my nigga
Heavy is the head but forgеt my nigga
Crown don dey bend from the stress my nigga
It's getting hard to suppress my liquor
So I'm drinking more wine at four thirty
I'd rather be online than out with company
Man I'm tryna numb my mind, the thoughts are too heavy
'Cause life is no joke we cope with comedy
I really no dey see your face
That's why we switch lanes, no dey indicate
Everybody wan blow, who dey pick the date?
God when will I be the one that they imitate
But most times I feel no one can relate

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
When there's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

But me I no fit to dey fight alone
Ou ha

[Verse 3: Ladipoe]
And you don't have to bro
What's a vaccine to an antidote
Blood, sweat, tears in my engine o
If you smell success that's my cologne
Broke almost every code
Still I got fans filling every row
This anointing from the microphone
And that's on God, only heaven knows

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running

I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Outro: Ladipoe]
I've been running for life
Pastor said I've been running from life
Tank on E I'm just running on vibes
Sweet white wine with some Henny combined
Let me unwind
Coz it's heavy all night
I don't want any on mine
You can unfriend me online
I'm just running, running running on vibes
Yeah, but you knew that
It's Ladipoe

To insult your intelligence why
Do I believe that we have met
Maybe not in these life
Time’s frozen for a second

Break the ice or better still we can set it aside
Temporarily my temperature is telling that
You got me so hot stuck
Girl there is no remedy yeah
But you don’t know me well enough to reply
And I don’t really know you that well
It’s funny you have something in your teeth
But would you try to stop me
If I want to take it out
‘Cause you don’t know me properly
Girl I think you love me
But you turn this bad boy into a busybody
I see you’re too busy for me
Or maybe I’m just busy for me
Will you call me when you’re ready for me ?

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, my mind
Yeah, yeah, my mind

[Verse 1]
I said five in the morning
I wake up to fight for my earning
Fear in my mind is a warning
Pray to the one you rely in
I've been wandering all day
I try to be fine but I can't be
The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me
I try to get by but I'm burning

[Pre-Chorus]
And behind my mind it runs
All these thoughts of troubling
Fighting to give up my pain
Fighting to be on my lane
My mind running to the other side
When it's time to live my life
Then it tries to take mе out
Tell you what I need right here

[Chorus]
I rеally need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need mine now
I really need, I need to free my mind now
I really need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need mind now, uh, yeah

[Verse 2]
This is the peace that you cannot buy
Send me a love that you cannot mix
One is the joy that you cannot waste
And the other one price that you cannot fix
This is the peace that you cannot buy
Finding the way, when you cannot see
Man will desist if he cannot pray
I need to find release

Mmm, oh
Higher, higher
Saying higher-er-er-er, ayy

[Verse 1]
Tell me why you're crying now kini big deal
When you gave me something I don't really feel
But you knew that already
When I found you on the ground you were dying
Now why you come into my yard, uninvited?
Can you see me on the edge? I'm enlightened

[Chorus]
If the world was ending
Would you cry or would you try to get me?
Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah
Tell me now, I need you to be clеar, yeah
I will wait for you, for you
I will wait for you, I will wait for you

[Verse 2]
Get me, can you put thе time on a rewind, yeah
Help me understand, can you tell me now
Why you made the war that we're fighting now
And you fall and you run when you see my big guns
Run around, run away as the rebel comes out
Then you call, call on me when you call me I come
But there you go again

Running away to the land of discovery
Running away from the suffering, I'm gone, yeah
Running away from the darkness, I'm out here, yeah

Higher than all the limits
Going way beyond the noise and your feelings
When you speak all I can hear is silence
Running back from all the pain and violence

Fall down when you see me, you know that
You know that I will stay for you

People always try to get involved
I feel like I'm dumb, I don't know where to run
People always trying to take a bite out of my mind
If you need a fight, maybe we could start
I feel I might just be coming undone
Tell me why you can't be found?
It's so unreasonable, I know you
Love is a difficult life
Maybe we should take it to the streets

[Pre-Chorus: Tems]
Basically, I might not be weak
Basically, I might not be falling
Basically, I might be used to this

[Chorus: Tems]
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2: Brent Faiyaz, Tems, Both]
Before this gets out of hand
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my mannеrs (I'll do)
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that
Can you picturе that? Yeah
I don't know who you been dealing with, but I–
Guarantee that you ain't been with this, because–
If you had you'll forget about the past
Before this gets out of hand (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my manners
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

What have the artists said about the song?
Genius Answer1 contributor
I was in LA with Brent; he is such an amazing artist. He always knows how to bring a different perspective. The song is really about releasing different thoughts in my head and reconciling them with my truth.

Yeah-yeah, yeah, no, woah, oh, oh-oh
Yeah-yeah, yeah, mm
Mm, mm-hmm, mm

[Verse 1]
Oh, my voice is a mystery
But they always tryna diss me
Same guys tryna get in my way
Keep the same vibe, you can't ruin my day
Oh, my voice is a mystery
Ride the wave of my history
I've been distant to keep my distance
Goodbye to a boring life
I like to seek but I'm never in sight
Even though I'm the type to ride
I like to care but e never reach fight
Swinging my waist like you never did see
And then I roll like I really get baked
And you can't believe what you heard me about me
It's the magic for me
They keep trying to reach me, yeah, yeah
It's the magic for me
I make them weep 'til they run insane
So get me lit on a weekday
I'm on the way and my ways on a display
And I'ma shut 'em all down one of these days
It's my time so put me on a replay

[Bridge]
Who this guy that they say they wan try me?
Who this guy and they say they wan play me?
Who this guy that they say they wan break?
Who this guy that they say they wan shake?
All this time that they wan break, yeah
All this time that them think they wan take, yeah
Who this guy that he say wan pie me?
Who this guy that he say he wan define me?
I've been 'round the world, nah, nah, nah
And when they call, boy, nah me they call (Oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh, ah)

[Verse 2]
Back then when I ain't have no friends
And yah condescend but I really won't rest see
Even though bro, I could let you go
But I really wan show that you really can't test me
Even on days, when they tried to arrest me
But if you live a lie, there's no way you could get me
Pissed em off, they locked me up in a celly
Then e shock dem when they see me on the telly
You know, I'm a vibe and I run it as usual
I didn't only come around just to make it
And I could shake things but I'll break it
You name it boy
Who knew I won't care for the things that you do?
I could turn let everyone try me
'Cause you never gonna get what is for me
Yeah-uh

No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have and good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

[Chorus]
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light, as it was
A log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
No, I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

Way out my feelings and nothing can stress me
The way I run the game I'm feeling like referee
No like Moses parting the red sea
Like a chaffeur, me in the back of Bentley
So I step out all white can’t stain
What you want? Rosè? Champagne?
I got that, big bag, back pain
Taking the piss, the only time I can't aim
So we toast to the good life
Living every minute to the full cause I could die
Pull up at the spot open doors and it's suicide
Chilling rent free
Where the check please? Couple hundred Gs on a good night

[Chorus: Buju]
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae
Spoil my blues and rhythm now

Ladipoe, Fireboy and Vibez man
Here's another story from a bad man
Vibez
But you knew that

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Verse 1: Ladipoe]
Even though the country don dey tire me
I dey catch cruise, Eko Miami
If only bad news could be bribed, take all my money
I like my lies sweet, tastes like irony
But that's the reason, I dey vеx my nigga
Heavy is the head but forgеt my nigga
Crown don dey bend from the stress my nigga
It's getting hard to suppress my liquor
So I'm drinking more wine at four thirty
I'd rather be online than out with company
Man I'm tryna numb my mind, the thoughts are too heavy
'Cause life is no joke we cope with comedy
I really no dey see your face
That's why we switch lanes, no dey indicate
Everybody wan blow, who dey pick the date?
God when will I be the one that they imitate
But most times I feel no one can relate

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
When there's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

Ain't leaving until it's time to go
Galloping like I'm an antelope
Ou ha

Lone soldier me I dey stand alone
Me I dey fight for my envelope
But me I no fit to dey fight alone
Ou ha

[Verse 3: Ladipoe]
And you don't have to bro
What's a vaccine to an antidote
Blood, sweat, tears in my engine o
If you smell success that's my cologne
Broke almost every code
Still I got fans filling every row
This anointing from the microphone
And that's on God, only heaven knows

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Outro: Ladipoe]
I've been running for life
Pastor said I've been running from life
Tank on E I'm just running on vibes
Sweet white wine with some Henny combined
Let me unwind
Coz it's heavy all night
I don't want any on mine
You can unfriend me online
I'm just running, running running on vibes
Yeah, but you knew that
It's Ladipoe

I wake up to fight for my earning
Fear in my mind is a warning
Pray to the one you rely in
I've been wandering all day
I try to be fine but I can't be
The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me
I try to get by but I'm burning

[Pre-Chorus]
And behind my mind it runs
All these thoughts of troubling
Fighting to give up my pain
Fighting to be on my lane
My mind running to the other side
When it's time to live my life
Then it tries to take mе out
Tell you what I need right here

[Chorus]
I rеally need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need mine now
I really need, I need to free my mind now
I really need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need mind now, uh, yeah

[Verse 2]
This is the peace that you cannot buy
Send me a love that you cannot mix
One is the joy that you cannot waste
And the other one price that you cannot fix
This is the peace that you cannot buy
Finding the way, when you cannot see
Man will desist if he cannot pray
I need to find release

Can you see me on the edge? I'm enlightened

People always try to get involved
I feel like I'm dumb, I don't know where to run
People always trying to take a bite out of my mind
If you need a fight, maybe we could start
I feel I might just be coming undone
Tell me why you can't be found?
It's so unreasonable, I know you
Love is a difficult life
Maybe we should take it to the streets

[Pre-Chorus: Tems]
Basically, I might not be weak
Basically, I might not be falling
Basically, I might be used to this

Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2: Brent Faiyaz, Tems, Both]
Before this gets out of hand
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my mannеrs (I'll do)
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that
Can you picturе that? Yeah
I don't know who you been dealing with, but I–
Guarantee that you ain't been with this, because–
If you had you'll forget about the past
Before this gets out of hand (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my manners
Won't take advantage

I was in LA with Brent; he is such an amazing artist. He always knows how to bring a different perspective. The song is really about releasing different thoughts in my head and reconciling them with my truth.

[Verse 1]
Oh, my voice is a mystery
But they always tryna diss me
Same guys tryna get in my way
Keep the same vibe, you can't ruin my day
Oh, my voice is a mystery
Ride the wave of my history
I've been distant to keep my distance
Goodbye to a boring life
I like to seek but I'm never in sight
Even though I'm the type to ride
I like to care but e never reach fight
Swinging my waist like you never did see
And then I roll like I really get baked
And you can't believe what you heard me about me
It's the magic for me
They keep trying to reach me, yeah, yeah
It's the magic for me
I make them weep 'til they run insane
So get me lit on a weekday
I'm on the way and my ways on a display
And I'ma shut 'em all down one of these days
It's my time so put me on a replay

[Bridge]
Who this guy that they say they wan try me?
Who this guy and they say they wan play me?
Who this guy that they say they wan break?
Who this guy that they say they wan shake?
All this time that they wan break, yeah
All this time that them think they wan take, yeah
Who this guy that he say wan pie me?
Who this guy that he say he wan define me?
I've been 'round the world, nah, nah, nah
And when they call, boy, nah me they call (Oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh, ah)

[Verse 2]
Back then when I ain't have no friends
And yah condescend but I really won't rest see
Even though bro, I could let you go
But I really wan show that you really can't test me
Even on days, when they tried to arrest me
But if you live a lie, there's no way you could get me
Pissed em off, they locked me up in a celly
Then e shock dem when they see me on the telly
You know, I'm a vibe and I run it as usual
I didn't only come around just to make it
And I could shake things but I'll break it
You name it boy
Who knew I won't care for the things that you do?
I could turn let everyone try me
'Cause you never gonna get what is for me
Yeah-uh

No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have and good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

[Chorus]
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light, as it was
A log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
No, I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

No like Moses parting the red sea
Like a chaffeur, me in the back of Bentley
So I step out all white can’t stain
What you want? Rosè? Champagne?
I got that, big bag, back pain
Taking the piss, the only time I can't aim
So we toast to the good life
Living every minute to the full cause I could die
Pull up at the spot open doors and it's suicide
Chilling rent free
Where the check please? Couple hundred Gs on a good night

Ladipoe, Fireboy and Vibez man
Here's another story from a bad man
Vibez
But you knew that

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Verse 1: Ladipoe]
Even though the country don dey tire me
I dey catch cruise, Eko Miami
If only bad news could be bribed, take all my money
I like my lies sweet, tastes like irony
But that's the reason, I dey vеx my nigga
Heavy is the head but forgеt my nigga
Crown don dey bend from the stress my nigga
It's getting hard to suppress my liquor
So I'm drinking more wine at four thirty
I'd rather be online than out with company
Man I'm tryna numb my mind, the thoughts are too heavy
'Cause life is no joke we cope with comedy
I really no dey see your face
That's why we switch lanes, no dey indicate
Everybody wan blow, who dey pick the date?
God when will I be the one that they imitate
But most times I feel no one can relate

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
When there's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

Galloping like I'm an antelope

Lone soldier me I dey stand alone
Me I dey fight for my envelope
But me I no fit to dey fight alone
Ou ha

[Verse 3: Ladipoe]
And you don't have to bro
What's a vaccine to an antidote
Blood, sweat, tears in my engine o
If you smell success that's my cologne
Broke almost every code
Still I got fans filling every row
This anointing from the microphone
And that's on God, only heaven knows

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Outro: Ladipoe]
I've been running for life
Pastor said I've been running from life
Tank on E I'm just running on vibes
Sweet white wine with some Henny combined
Let me unwind
Coz it's heavy all night
I don't want any on mine
You can unfriend me online
I'm just running, running running on vibes
Yeah, but you knew that
It's Ladipoe

Can you see me on the edge? I'm enlightened

Would you cry or would you try to get me?

People always try to get involved
I feel like I'm dumb, I don't know where to run
People always trying to take a bite out of my mind
If you need a fight, maybe we could start
I feel I might just be coming undone
Tell me why you can't be found?
It's so unreasonable, I know you
Love is a difficult life
Maybe we should take it to the streets

What have the artists said about the song?
Genius Answer1 contributor
I was in LA with Brent; he is such an amazing artist. He always knows how to bring a different perspective. The song is really about releasing different thoughts in my head and reconciling them with my truth.

One time you tell me one chance

Open your eyes, open your eyes, babe

Yeah-yeah, yeah, no, woah, oh, oh-oh
Yeah-yeah, yeah, mm
Mm, mm-hmm, mm

[Verse 1]
Oh, my voice is a mystery
But they always tryna diss me
Same guys tryna get in my way
Keep the same vibe, you can't ruin my day
Oh, my voice is a mystery
Ride the wave of my history
I've been distant to keep my distance
Goodbye to a boring life
I like to seek but I'm never in sight
Even though I'm the type to ride
I like to care but e never reach fight
Swinging my waist like you never did see
And then I roll like I really get baked
And you can't believe what you heard me about me
It's the magic for me
They keep trying to reach me, yeah, yeah
It's the magic for me
I make them weep 'til they run insane
So get me lit on a weekday
I'm on the way and my ways on a display
And I'ma shut 'em all down one of these days
It's my time so put me on a replay

[Bridge]
Who this guy that they say they wan try me?
Who this guy and they say they wan play me?
Who this guy that they say they wan break?
Who this guy that they say they wan shake?
All this time that they wan break, yeah
All this time that them think they wan take, yeah
Who this guy that he say wan pie me?
Who this guy that he say he wan define me?
I've been 'round the world, nah, nah, nah
And when they call, boy, nah me they call (Oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh, ah)

[Verse 2]
Back then when I ain't have no friends
And yah condescend but I really won't rest see
Even though bro, I could let you go
But I really wan show that you really can't test me
Even on days, when they tried to arrest me
But if you live a lie, there's no way you could get me
Pissed em off, they locked me up in a celly
Then e shock dem when they see me on the telly
You know, I'm a vibe and I run it as usual
I didn't only come around just to make it
And I could shake things but I'll break it
You name it boy
Who knew I won't care for the things that you do?
I could turn let everyone try me
'Cause you never gonna get what is for me
Yeah-uh

No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have and good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

[Chorus]
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light, as it was
A log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
No, I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

Omo e get small thing wey dey stress me
But right now I'm chilling now

[Verse 1: Ladipoe]
Way out my feelings and nothing can stress me
The way I run the game I'm feeling like referee
No like Moses parting the red sea
Like a chaffeur, me in the back of Bentley
So I step out all white can’t stain
What you want? Rosè? Champagne?
I got that, big bag, back pain
Taking the piss, the only time I can't aim
So we toast to the good life
Living every minute to the full cause I could die
Pull up at the spot open doors and it's suicide
Chilling rent free
Where the check please? Couple hundred Gs on a good night

[Chorus: Buju]
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae
Spoil my blues and rhythm now
Oh oh oh oh
I like the way I'm feeling now

Ladipoe, Fireboy and Vibez man
Here's another story from a bad man
Vibez
But you knew that

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Verse 1: Ladipoe]
Even though the country don dey tire me
I dey catch cruise, Eko Miami
If only bad news could be bribed, take all my money
I like my lies sweet, tastes like irony
But that's the reason, I dey vеx my nigga
Heavy is the head but forgеt my nigga
Crown don dey bend from the stress my nigga
It's getting hard to suppress my liquor
So I'm drinking more wine at four thirty
I'd rather be online than out with company
Man I'm tryna numb my mind, the thoughts are too heavy
'Cause life is no joke we cope with comedy
I really no dey see your face
That's why we switch lanes, no dey indicate
Everybody wan blow, who dey pick the date?
God when will I be the one that they imitate
But most times I feel no one can relate

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
When there's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

Me I dey fight for my envelope
But me I no fit to dey fight alone
Ou ha

[Verse 3: Ladipoe]
And you don't have to bro
What's a vaccine to an antidote
Blood, sweat, tears in my engine o
If you smell success that's my cologne
Broke almost every code
Still I got fans filling every row
This anointing from the microphone
And that's on God, only heaven knows

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Outro: Ladipoe]
I've been running for life
Pastor said I've been running from life
Tank on E I'm just running on vibes
Sweet white wine with some Henny combined
Let me unwind
Coz it's heavy all night
I don't want any on mine
You can unfriend me online
I'm just running, running running on vibes
Yeah, but you knew that
It's Ladipoe

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, my mind
Yeah, yeah, my mind

[Verse 1]
I said five in the morning
I wake up to fight for my earning
Fear in my mind is a warning
Pray to the one you rely in
I've been wandering all day
I try to be fine but I can't be
The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me
I try to get by but I'm burning

[Pre-Chorus]
And behind my mind it runs
All these thoughts of troubling
Fighting to give up my pain
Fighting to be on my lane
My mind running to the other side
When it's time to live my life
Then it tries to take mе out
Tell you what I need right here

[Chorus]
I rеally need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need mine now
I really need, I need to free my mind now
I really need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need mind now, uh, yeah

[Verse 2]
This is the peace that you cannot buy
Send me a love that you cannot mix
One is the joy that you cannot waste
And the other one price that you cannot fix
This is the peace that you cannot buy
Finding the way, when you cannot see
Man will desist if he cannot pray
I need to find release

Tell me why you're crying now kini big deal

But you knew that already
When I found you on the ground you were dying
Now why you come into my yard, uninvited?
Can you see me on the edge? I'm enlightened

[Chorus]
If the world was ending
Would you cry or would you try to get me?
Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah

Get me, can you put thе time on a rewind, yeah
Help me understand, can you tell me now

People always try to get involved
I feel like I'm dumb, I don't know where to run
People always trying to take a bite out of my mind
If you need a fight, maybe we could start
I feel I might just be coming undone
Tell me why you can't be found?
It's so unreasonable, I know you
Love is a difficult life
Maybe we should take it to the streets

[Pre-Chorus: Tems]
Basically, I might not be weak
Basically, I might not be falling
Basically, I might be used to this

Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found

Before this gets out of hand
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my mannеrs (I'll do)
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that
Can you picturе that? Yeah
I don't know who you been dealing with, but I–
Guarantee that you ain't been with this, because–
If you had you'll forget about the past
Before this gets out of hand (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

What have the artists said about the song?
Genius Answer1 contributor
I was in LA with Brent; he is such an amazing artist. He always knows how to bring a different perspective. The song is really about releasing different thoughts in my head and reconciling them with my truth.

Yeah-yeah, yeah, no, woah, oh, oh-oh
Yeah-yeah, yeah, mm
Mm, mm-hmm, mm

[Verse 1]
Oh, my voice is a mystery
But they always tryna diss me
Same guys tryna get in my way
Keep the same vibe, you can't ruin my day
Oh, my voice is a mystery
Ride the wave of my history
I've been distant to keep my distance
Goodbye to a boring life
I like to seek but I'm never in sight
Even though I'm the type to ride
I like to care but e never reach fight
Swinging my waist like you never did see
And then I roll like I really get baked
And you can't believe what you heard me about me
It's the magic for me
They keep trying to reach me, yeah, yeah
It's the magic for me
I make them weep 'til they run insane
So get me lit on a weekday
I'm on the way and my ways on a display
And I'ma shut 'em all down one of these days
It's my time so put me on a replay

[Bridge]
Who this guy that they say they wan try me?
Who this guy and they say they wan play me?
Who this guy that they say they wan break?
Who this guy that they say they wan shake?
All this time that they wan break, yeah
All this time that them think they wan take, yeah
Who this guy that he say wan pie me?
Who this guy that he say he wan define me?
I've been 'round the world, nah, nah, nah
And when they call, boy, nah me they call (Oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh, ah)

[Verse 2]
Back then when I ain't have no friends
And yah condescend but I really won't rest see
Even though bro, I could let you go
But I really wan show that you really can't test me
Even on days, when they tried to arrest me
But if you live a lie, there's no way you could get me
Pissed em off, they locked me up in a celly
Then e shock dem when they see me on the telly
You know, I'm a vibe and I run it as usual
I didn't only come around just to make it
And I could shake things but I'll break it
You name it boy
Who knew I won't care for the things that you do?
I could turn let everyone try me
'Cause you never gonna get what is for me
Yeah-uh

No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have and good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

[Chorus]
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light, as it was
A log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
No, I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

No like Moses parting the red sea
Like a chaffeur, me in the back of Bentley
So I step out all white can’t stain
What you want? Rosè? Champagne?
I got that, big bag, back pain
Taking the piss, the only time I can't aim
So we toast to the good life
Living every minute to the full cause I could die
Pull up at the spot open doors and it's suicide
Chilling rent free
Where the check please? Couple hundred Gs on a good night

[Chorus: Buju]

I like my lies sweet, tastes like irony
But that's the reason, I dey vеx my nigga
Heavy is the head but forgеt my nigga
Crown don dey bend from the stress my nigga
It's getting hard to suppress my liquor
So I'm drinking more wine at four thirty
I'd rather be online than out with company
Man I'm tryna numb my mind, the thoughts are too heavy
'Cause life is no joke we cope with comedy
I really no dey see your face
That's why we switch lanes, no dey indicate
Everybody wan blow, who dey pick the date?
God when will I be the one that they imitate
But most times I feel no one can relate

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
When there's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

Galloping like I'm an antelope

Lone soldier me I dey stand alone
Me I dey fight for my envelope
But me I no fit to dey fight alone
Ou ha

[Verse 3: Ladipoe]
And you don't have to bro
What's a vaccine to an antidote
Blood, sweat, tears in my engine o
If you smell success that's my cologne
Broke almost every code
Still I got fans filling every row
This anointing from the microphone
And that's on God, only heaven knows

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Outro: Ladipoe]
I've been running for life
Pastor said I've been running from life
Tank on E I'm just running on vibes
Sweet white wine with some Henny combined
Let me unwind
Coz it's heavy all night
I don't want any on mine
You can unfriend me online
I'm just running, running running on vibes
Yeah, but you knew that
It's Ladipoe

Fighting to give up my pain
Fighting to be on my lane
My mind running to the other side

Tell you what I need right here

Tell me why you're crying now kini big deal

Now why you come into my yard, uninvited?
Can you see me on the edge? I'm enlightened

If the world was ending
Would you cry or would you try to get me?

People always try to get involved
I feel like I'm dumb, I don't know where to run
People always trying to take a bite out of my mind
If you need a fight, maybe we could start
I feel I might just be coming undone
Tell me why you can't be found?
It's so unreasonable, I know you
Love is a difficult life
Maybe we should take it to the streets

[Pre-Chorus: Tems]
Basically, I might not be weak
Basically, I might not be falling
Basically, I might be used to this

[Chorus: Tems]
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2: Brent Faiyaz, Tems, Both]
Before this gets out of hand
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my mannеrs (I'll do)
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that
Can you picturе that? Yeah
I don't know who you been dealing with, but I–
Guarantee that you ain't been with this, because–
If you had you'll forget about the past
Before this gets out of hand (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my manners
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

I was in LA with Brent; he is such an amazing artist. He always knows how to bring a different perspective. The song is really about releasing different thoughts in my head and reconciling them with my truth.

[Verse 1]
Oh, my voice is a mystery
But they always tryna diss me
Same guys tryna get in my way
Keep the same vibe, you can't ruin my day
Oh, my voice is a mystery
Ride the wave of my history
I've been distant to keep my distance
Goodbye to a boring life
I like to seek but I'm never in sight
Even though I'm the type to ride
I like to care but e never reach fight
Swinging my waist like you never did see
And then I roll like I really get baked
And you can't believe what you heard me about me
It's the magic for me
They keep trying to reach me, yeah, yeah
It's the magic for me
I make them weep 'til they run insane
So get me lit on a weekday
I'm on the way and my ways on a display
And I'ma shut 'em all down one of these days
It's my time so put me on a replay

[Bridge]
Who this guy that they say they wan try me?
Who this guy and they say they wan play me?
Who this guy that they say they wan break?
Who this guy that they say they wan shake?
All this time that they wan break, yeah
All this time that them think they wan take, yeah
Who this guy that he say wan pie me?
Who this guy that he say he wan define me?
I've been 'round the world, nah, nah, nah
And when they call, boy, nah me they call (Oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh, ah)

[Verse 2]
Back then when I ain't have no friends
And yah condescend but I really won't rest see
Even though bro, I could let you go
But I really wan show that you really can't test me
Even on days, when they tried to arrest me
But if you live a lie, there's no way you could get me
Pissed em off, they locked me up in a celly
Then e shock dem when they see me on the telly
You know, I'm a vibe and I run it as usual
I didn't only come around just to make it
And I could shake things but I'll break it
You name it boy
Who knew I won't care for the things that you do?
I could turn let everyone try me
'Cause you never gonna get what is for me
Yeah-uh

No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have and good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

[Chorus]
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light, as it was
A log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
No, I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright
So woman, no cry, cry, cry
No, woman, no (Woman, no)
So woman, no cry, no cry
No, woman, no cry

[Outro]
Hmm
Ooh

[Chorus: Buju]
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae
Spoil my blues and rhythm now
Oh oh oh oh
I like the way I'm feeling now
Omo e get small thing wey dey stress me
But right now I'm chilling now
Oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1: Ladipoe]
Way out my feelings and nothing can stress me
The way I run the game I'm feeling like referee
No like Moses parting the red sea
Like a chaffeur, me in the back of Bentley
So I step out all white can’t stain
What you want? Rosè? Champagne?
I got that, big bag, back pain
Taking the piss, the only time I can't aim
So we toast to the good life
Living every minute to the full cause I could die
Pull up at the spot open doors and it's suicide
Chilling rent free
Where the check please? Couple hundred Gs on a good night

[Chorus: Buju]
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae
Spoil my blues and rhythm now
Oh oh oh oh
I like the way I'm feeling now
Omo e get small thing wey dey stress me
But right now I'm chilling now
Oh oh oh oh
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae
Spoil my blues and rhythm now
No oh oh oh
I like the way I'm feeling now
Omo e get small thing wey dey stress me
But right now I'm chilling now

Throw myself a party then act surprised
And be the highest in the room when the guest arrive yeah
Ain't nobody realer, touch down, got a couple Gs for the dealer
Gang signs out the window my killah
Life getting sweeter no use water dilute my Ribena
So we toast to the good life
Every minute to the full cause we could die
Pull up open doors and it's suicide
16 bad woop and they all by the poolside

Ladipoe, Fireboy and Vibez man
Here's another story from a bad man
Vibez
But you knew that

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Verse 1: Ladipoe]
Even though the country don dey tire me
I dey catch cruise, Eko Miami
If only bad news could be bribed, take all my money
I like my lies sweet, tastes like irony
But that's the reason, I dey vеx my nigga
Heavy is the head but forgеt my nigga
Crown don dey bend from the stress my nigga
It's getting hard to suppress my liquor
So I'm drinking more wine at four thirty
I'd rather be online than out with company
Man I'm tryna numb my mind, the thoughts are too heavy
'Cause life is no joke we cope with comedy
I really no dey see your face
That's why we switch lanes, no dey indicate
Everybody wan blow, who dey pick the date?
God when will I be the one that they imitate
But most times I feel no one can relate

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
When there's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

Afrobeats or na kpangolo
I took that shit international
Ain't leaving until it's time to go
Galloping like I'm an antelope
Ou ha
I took it personal
Lone soldier me I dey stand alone
Me I dey fight for my envelope
But me I no fit to dey fight alone
Ou ha

[Verse 3: Ladipoe]
And you don't have to bro
What's a vaccine to an antidote
Blood, sweat, tears in my engine o
If you smell success that's my cologne
Broke almost every code
Still I got fans filling every row
This anointing from the microphone
And that's on God, only heaven knows

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Outro: Ladipoe]
I've been running for life
Pastor said I've been running from life
Tank on E I'm just running on vibes
Sweet white wine with some Henny combined
Let me unwind
Coz it's heavy all night
I don't want any on mine
You can unfriend me online
I'm just running, running running on vibes
Yeah, but you knew that
It's Ladipoe

Everybody talks but be careful with your tone
Many have the number but I only pick the phone
For that

To insult your intelligence why
Do I believe that we have met
Maybe not in these life
Time’s frozen for a second
So I’m thinking tonight
Break the ice or better still we can set it aside
Temporarily my temperature is telling that
You got me so hot stuck
Girl there is no remedy yeah
But you don’t know me well enough to reply
And I don’t really know you that well
It’s funny you have something in your teeth
But would you try to stop me
If I want to take it out
‘Cause you don’t know me properly
Girl I think you love me
But you turn this bad boy into a busybody
I see you’re too busy for me
Or maybe I’m just busy for me
Will you call me when you’re ready for me ?

Spend every night
Telling bad jokes to you
Be my boyfriend

Have a baby with my boyfriend genes
If you are my boyfriend
