Green-white-green flag flown near the vulture
Mummy left her home, took a flight, be the poster
Child take note in the wild, this that kingdom come
Black skin, white world, that's my thesis done
Rock, paper, scissors, the mission is classified
I was doing nine-to-five, I been lost in who am Is
Who are you, who are we?
I'm obsessed with breaking free
Big woman Enny but for aunty, I still bend my knee
If I change, that's fine
Why not sweep, when I go marry, that's mine
But you keep saying I don't fit in, man, I told you
When you see me and my fam, that's culture

Stop

[Verse 1: Boj]
Home girl wanna get it
Her boyfriend kinda livid
Every story got two sides
He ain't even tryna listen
She was feeling on my steez bro
I was swishing like a free throw eh
Fucking with my lingo
Now she come dey find me like nemo
I just wanna kiss her
I just wanna kiss her on the lips ha
Baby tell your mister
Tell your mister hasta la vista

[Hook: Boj]
If you like I'm ready to take the deal
I just want you to tell me just how you feel

[Chorus:]
What we fi do? We're stuck in a loop
Nobody's gonna win this game
Can't leave him, cannot leave my baby
What we fi do? keep it on a low
Nobody's gonna win this gamе
Can't lеave him, cannot leavе my baby

Fucking with my lingo
Now she come dey find me like nemo

I just wanna kiss her on the lips ha
Baby tell your mister
Tell your mister hasta la vista

What we fi do? We're stuck in a loop
Nobody's gonna win this game
Can't leave him, cannot leave my baby

Ayy, yeah
Green-white-green flag flown near the vulture
Mummy left her home, took a flight, be the poster
Child take note in the wild, this that kingdom come
Black skin, white world, that's my thesis done
Rock, paper, scissors, the mission is classified
I was doing nine-to-five, I been lost in who am Is
Who are you, who are we?
I'm obsessed with breaking free
Big woman Enny but for aunty, I still bend my knee
If I change, that's fine
Why not sweep, when I go marry, that's mine
But you keep saying I don't fit in, man, I told you
When you see me and my fam, that's culture

[Chorus: BOJ]
If you get chance, make you come Lagos
If dem want dance, dem go come play us
If you get hands, make you come Gbagada
You go see say we no get palava
We dey find dough brothers in the ghetto
And told you, on it from the get go
I no dey sleep o, always on my ten toes
Married to the game and I no go let go

Tapping on her pussy like I'm tryna kill a motherfucking insect
Oh-ah-ah-ah
