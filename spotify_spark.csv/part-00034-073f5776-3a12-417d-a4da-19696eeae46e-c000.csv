Mummy left her home, took a flight, be the poster
Child take note in the wild, this that kingdom come
Black skin, white world, that's my thesis done
Rock, paper, scissors, the mission is classified
I was doing nine-to-five, I been lost in who am Is
Who are you, who are we?
I'm obsessed with breaking free
Big woman Enny but for aunty, I still bend my knee

Why not sweep, when I go marry, that's mine
But you keep saying I don't fit in, man, I told you

Fucking with my lingo
Now she come dey find me like nemo

I just wanna kiss her on the lips ha
Baby tell your mister
Tell your mister hasta la vista

[Hook: Boj]
If you like I'm ready to take the deal

What we fi do? We're stuck in a loop
Nobody's gonna win this game
Can't leave him, cannot leave my baby
What we fi do? keep it on a low

Sweet baby melanin sweeter than sugarcane

Sex like a gangster but my face innocent
Stroke her pussy with my index
Shawty gotta orgasm
Tapping on her pussy like I'm tryna kill a motherfucking insect
Oh-ah-ah-ah

Big woman Enny but for aunty, I still bend my knee

She grabbed my neck and she whisper, \"Please\"
Shawty give me dirty splash from my chest to my knees

Yeah, yeah

I give her number one, she need a bucket quick
And when we done, she feed me like a majesty
Grape, grape, grape, grape, grape, grape, grape, grape, hm-hm
Round two kpe, kpe, kpe, hm-hm

[Bridge]
Baby girl your body is my medicine
Sweet baby melanin sweeter than sugarcane
Give her hickey hickey on her neck
Sex like a gangster but my face innocent
Stroke her pussy with my index
Shawty gotta orgasm
Tapping on her pussy like I'm tryna kill a motherfucking insect
Oh-ah-ah-ah
