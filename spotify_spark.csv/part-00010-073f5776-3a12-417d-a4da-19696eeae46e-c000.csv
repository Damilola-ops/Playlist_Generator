Child take note in the wild, this that kingdom come
Black skin, white world, that's my thesis done
Rock, paper, scissors, the mission is classified
I was doing nine-to-five, I been lost in who am Is
Who are you, who are we?
I'm obsessed with breaking free
Big woman Enny but for aunty, I still bend my knee

Why not sweep, when I go marry, that's mine

Baby tell your mister
Tell your mister hasta la vista

Mummy left her home, took a flight, be the poster
Child take note in the wild, this that kingdom come
Black skin, white world, that's my thesis done

I was doing nine-to-five, I been lost in who am Is
Who are you, who are we?
I'm obsessed with breaking free
Big woman Enny but for aunty, I still bend my knee
If I change, that's fine
Why not sweep, when I go marry, that's mine
But you keep saying I don't fit in, man, I told you
When you see me and my fam, that's culture

If dem want dance, dem go come play us
If you get hands, make you come Gbagada

Be thеre when I need ya
Pull all of the vibes on me
Turn the light on baby
Love when you got your eyes on me
My man ain't home this weekend
Maybe we can just pretend to
We get caught I defend you
No way I'm gonna lose this
Got me acting a fool
I can't help it you know it
Baby you got me wanting

[Hook: Boj]
If you like I'm ready to take the deal
I just want you to tell me just how you feel

[Chorus:]
What we fi do? We're stuck in a loop
Nobody's gonna win this game
Can't leave him, cannot leave my baby
What we fi do? keep it on a low
Nobody's gonna win this gamе
Can't leave him, cannot leavе my baby

[Verse 3: ]
Her bobo feel some way
But he no fit talk to me
Cause I give her gara love
I give her gara love, power love
Keep it confidential that's all mi saying
No matter what the case don't say it
Did I mention? Missed you today
Give me gara love, power love
No I didn't call you
I was with him today
Was I on your mind too?
Did it hurt to make you wait?

[Hook: Boj]
If you like I'm ready to take the deal
I just want you to tell me just how you feel

What we fi do? We're stuck in a loop
Nobody's gonna win this game
Can't leave him, cannot leave my baby
What we fi do? keep it on a low
Nobody's gonna win this gamе
Can't leave him, cannot leavе my baby
