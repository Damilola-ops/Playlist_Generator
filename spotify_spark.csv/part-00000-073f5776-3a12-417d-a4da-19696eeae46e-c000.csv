Make ah give you all you need, baby, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

[Chorus: Tems & Wizkid]
You don't need no other body
You don't need no other body (Woah, woah, woah)
Only you fi hold my body
Only you fi hold my body (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
You don't need no other body

[Outro: Wizkid]
Baby girl, I want you there, girl I want you there
Promise to treat your love fair, woah-woah, woah-woah
When we touch, how we connect, woah-woah, woah-woah
Said this love, have no regret, woah-woah, yeah-yeah
