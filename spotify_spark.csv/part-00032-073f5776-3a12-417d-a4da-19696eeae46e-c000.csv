Gave you all you need, gave you all you need
Gave you all, you give me all you need, give you all you need, gave you all
Make ah give you all you need, every touch you need, give you all
Make ah give you all you need, baby, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

[Chorus: Tems & Wizkid]
You don't need no other body
You don't need no other body (Woah, woah, woah)
Only you fi hold my body
Only you fi hold my body (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
You don't need no other body

[Outro: Wizkid]
Baby girl, I want you there, girl I want you there
Promise to treat your love fair, woah-woah, woah-woah
When we touch, how we connect, woah-woah, woah-woah
Said this love, have no regret, woah-woah, yeah-yeah

How to Format Lyrics:
Type out all lyrics, even repeating song parts like the chorus
Lyrics should be broken down into individual lines
Use section headers above different song parts like [Verse], [Chorus], etc.
Use italics (<i>lyric</i>) and bold (<b>lyric</b>) to distinguish between different vocalists in the same song part
If you don’t understand a lyric, use [?]
