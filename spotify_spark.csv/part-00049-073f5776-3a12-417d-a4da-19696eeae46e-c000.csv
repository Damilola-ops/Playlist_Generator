Steady moving, I'm just living life
And so many people in my business, so many chookin' eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
My fears are easier to face now (To face now)
In the front of my haters
Steady chasing my paper (Ooh-ooh)
Sipping Martel with no chaser (Ooh)
My steps are guided by Jehovah
And 44 looking over
Dem no fit stop us, I know that
And every show is a shutdown (Uh, uh)

[Chorus]
'Cause I stand strong
O.B.O no go minus
O.B.O Elemi 9 plus
Big fish flow like the ocean, oh

[Verse 2]
Look in my eyes
You see the money and the fame, we're successful
You really don't know what's going on in my life
In my life (What's going on in my life, yeah, yeah)
No pleasure comes from pain
No money fall like rain
This thing dey burst my brain
But it's all love (But it's all love)

Rii!

[Verse 1]
Papa told me, \"Keep your head up high
Even though your body full of bite marks from all dem canines\" (All dem canines, yeah, yeah)
Steady moving, I'm just living life
And so many people in my business, so many chookin' eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
My fears are easier to face now (To face now)
In the front of my haters
Steady chasing my paper (Ooh-ooh)
Sipping Martel with no chaser (Ooh)
My steps are guided by Jehovah
And 44 looking over
Dem no fit stop us, I know that
And every show is a shutdown (Uh, uh)

[Chorus]
'Cause I stand strong
O.B.O no go minus
O.B.O Elemi 9 plus
Big fish flow like the ocean, oh
Omo I stand Strong
30BG dеy my back, oh
O.B.O Elemi 9 plus
Can't deny my devotion, no

[Post-Chorus]
'Causе I stand strong
O.B.O no go minus
O.B.O Elemi 9 plus
Can't deny my devotion, no

[Verse 2]
Look in my eyes
You see the money and the fame, we're successful
You really don't know what's going on in my life
In my life (What's going on in my life, yeah, yeah)
No pleasure comes from pain
No money fall like rain
This thing dey burst my brain
But it's all love (But it's all love)

Rii!

[Verse 1]
Papa told me, \"Keep your head up high
Even though your body full of bite marks from all dem canines\" (All dem canines, yeah, yeah)
Steady moving, I'm just living life
And so many people in my business, so many chookin' eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
My fears are easier to face now (To face now)
In the front of my haters
Steady chasing my paper (Ooh-ooh)
Sipping Martel with no chaser (Ooh)
My steps are guided by Jehovah
And 44 looking over
Dem no fit stop us, I know that
And every show is a shutdown (Uh, uh)

[Chorus]
'Cause I stand strong
O.B.O no go minus
O.B.O Elemi 9 plus
Big fish flow like the ocean, oh
Omo I stand Strong

Can't deny my devotion, no

[Post-Chorus]
'Causе I stand strong

[Verse 2]
Look in my eyes
You see the money and the fame, we're successful
You really don't know what's going on in my life
In my life (What's going on in my life, yeah, yeah)
No pleasure comes from pain
No money fall like rain
This thing dey burst my brain
But it's all love (But it's all love)

Rii!

[Verse 1]
Papa told me, \"Keep your head up high
Even though your body full of bite marks from all dem canines\" (All dem canines, yeah, yeah)
Steady moving, I'm just living life
And so many people in my business, so many chookin' eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
My fears are easier to face now (To face now)
In the front of my haters
Steady chasing my paper (Ooh-ooh)
Sipping Martel with no chaser (Ooh)
My steps are guided by Jehovah
And 44 looking over
Dem no fit stop us, I know that
And every show is a shutdown (Uh, uh)

[Chorus]
'Cause I stand strong
O.B.O no go minus
O.B.O Elemi 9 plus
Big fish flow like the ocean, oh
Omo I stand Strong
30BG dеy my back, oh
O.B.O Elemi 9 plus
Can't deny my devotion, no

[Post-Chorus]
'Causе I stand strong
O.B.O no go minus
O.B.O Elemi 9 plus
Can't deny my devotion, no

[Verse 2]
Look in my eyes
You see the money and the fame, we're successful
You really don't know what's going on in my life
In my life (What's going on in my life, yeah, yeah)
No pleasure comes from pain
No money fall like rain
This thing dey burst my brain
But it's all love (But it's all love)
