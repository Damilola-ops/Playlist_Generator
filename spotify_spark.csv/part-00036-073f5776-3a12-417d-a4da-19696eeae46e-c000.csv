‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.

‚ÄúContour‚Äù is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi‚Äôs emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, ‚ÄúA contour is something that‚Äôs not straightforward, that‚Äôs not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It‚Äôs a heartbreak song, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äòfeelsgood‚Äô heartbreak song\",
That‚Äôs keeps you wanting it on repeat.
