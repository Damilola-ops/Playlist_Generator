Wetin you go do?

But nobody hears you?

You've been pullin' out knives from your behind

Don't leave me, don't leave me, oh God
Don't let me go down, don't let me go down
As far as I can see, na the memories
Dem dey carry me from reality
No require visa; I have been
Very quietly dyin'
And I need you to remind me why
Give me the strength to keep fightin'
'Cause I no fit trust anybody
Na hin make I no fit shout

[Chorus]
My body don dey tire, eh
E make me madder, eh
My head don scatter, eh
My holy father, eh
My body don dey tire, eh
E make me madder, eh
When my whole world is set on fire
Don't leave me alone

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Mm-mm, mm
Mm-mhm, mm

“On The Low” by Burna Boy is a nice mid-tempo love song with a fusion of Afrobeat and very subtle dancehall influences.
