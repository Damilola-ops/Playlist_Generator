My feelings still dey swing like jangolova
Feelings still dey swing like-
Ti n ba ni kе juru, e juru
Omo why to’o ki nfe ni suru?
Why you say I did nothing for you
When I for do anything you want mе to do
Ti n ba ni ke juru, e juru (E juru)
Omo why to'o ki nfe ni suru? (Ni suru)
Why you say I did nothing for you
When I for do anything you want me to do
Maybe another time, maybe another life you will be my wife and we'll get it right
E don cast, last last, na everybody go chop breakfast
Have to say bye bye o, bye bye o to the love of my life
My eye o don cry o

“Contour” is but a taste of what Joeboy has in store for his fans. The single is set to appear on his upcoming, highly-anticipated sophomore album, due later this year via Mr Eazi’s emPawa Africa. The accompanying music video is said to be out soon!
On his melodically melancholic release, Joeboy says, “A contour is something that’s not straightforward, that’s not symmetrical, not a straight line. This song deals with the contour of a relationship. It’s a heartbreak song, but it’s a ‘feelsgood’ heartbreak song"",
That’s keeps you wanting it on repeat.

In this song, both singers talk about what seems to be a one-sided relationship. They are starved of affection and attention and ask their partners to show them ‘something.’
This distressing situation makes them to ask questions of resorting to smoking and drinking the pain away.
Attention is the first collaboration between Afro-Fusion artiste, Omah Lay and Canadian pop-star, Justin Bieber.
Although this isn’t the first time Justin Bieber and Omah Lay have linked up as the Nigerian singer was featured on the Masterkraft remix of Justin Bieber’s “Peaches” alongside Alpha P in 2021.

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, my mind
Yeah, yeah, my mind

[Verse 1]
I said five in the morning
I wake up to fight for my earning
Fear in my mind is a warning
Pray to the one you rely in
I've been wandering all day
I try to be fine but I can't be
The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me
I try to get by but I'm burning

[Pre-Chorus]
And behind my mind it runs
All these thoughts of troubling
Fighting to give up my pain
Fighting to be on my lane
My mind running to the other side
When it's time to live my life
Then it tries to take mе out
Tell you what I need right here

[Chorus]
I rеally need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need mine now
I really need, I need to free my mind now
I really need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need mind now, uh, yeah

[Verse 2]
This is the peace that you cannot buy
Send me a love that you cannot mix
One is the joy that you cannot waste
And the other one price that you cannot fix
This is the peace that you cannot buy
Finding the way, when you cannot see
Man will desist if he cannot pray
I need to find release

Mmm, oh

Saying higher-er-er-er, ayy

Tell me why you're crying now kini big deal
When you gave me something I don't really feel
But you knew that already
When I found you on the ground you were dying
Now why you come into my yard, uninvited?
Can you see me on the edge? I'm enlightened

[Chorus]
If the world was ending
Would you cry or would you try to get me?
Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah
Tell me now, I need you to be clеar, yeah
I will wait for you, for you
I will wait for you, I will wait for you

[Verse 2]
Get me, can you put thе time on a rewind, yeah
Help me understand, can you tell me now
Why you made the war that we're fighting now
And you fall and you run when you see my big guns
Run around, run away as the rebel comes out
Then you call, call on me when you call me I come
But there you go again

[Verse 3]
With your deaf ears
Open your mind to the sound of the trumpet
What do you want from a life of the hopeless
Now here you are, you're begging and crying
I want to fly, yeah, I'm flying till morning
Running away to the land of discovery
Running away from the suffering, I'm gone, yeah
Running away from the darkness, I'm out here, yeah

People always try to get involved
I feel like I'm dumb, I don't know where to run
People always trying to take a bite out of my mind
If you need a fight, maybe we could start
I feel I might just be coming undone
Tell me why you can't be found?
It's so unreasonable, I know you
Love is a difficult life
Maybe we should take it to the streets

Basically, I might not be weak

No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh)

Can you picturе that? Yeah
I don't know who you been dealing with, but I–
Guarantee that you ain't been with this, because–
If you had you'll forget about the past

I was in LA with Brent; he is such an amazing artist. He always knows how to bring a different perspective. The song is really about releasing different thoughts in my head and reconciling them with my truth.

Mm, mm-hmm, mm

[Verse 1]
Oh, my voice is a mystery
But they always tryna diss me
Same guys tryna get in my way
Keep the same vibe, you can't ruin my day
Oh, my voice is a mystery
Ride the wave of my history
I've been distant to keep my distance
Goodbye to a boring life
I like to seek but I'm never in sight
Even though I'm the type to ride
I like to care but e never reach fight
Swinging my waist like you never did see
And then I roll like I really get baked
And you can't believe what you heard me about me
It's the magic for me
They keep trying to reach me, yeah, yeah
It's the magic for me
I make them weep 'til they run insane
So get me lit on a weekday
I'm on the way and my ways on a display
And I'ma shut 'em all down one of these days
It's my time so put me on a replay

[Bridge]
Who this guy that they say they wan try me?
Who this guy and they say they wan play me?
Who this guy that they say they wan break?
Who this guy that they say they wan shake?
All this time that they wan break, yeah
All this time that them think they wan take, yeah
Who this guy that he say wan pie me?
Who this guy that he say he wan define me?
I've been 'round the world, nah, nah, nah
And when they call, boy, nah me they call (Oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh, ah)

[Verse 2]
Back then when I ain't have no friends
And yah condescend but I really won't rest see
Even though bro, I could let you go
But I really wan show that you really can't test me
Even on days, when they tried to arrest me
But if you live a lie, there's no way you could get me
Pissed em off, they locked me up in a celly
Then e shock dem when they see me on the telly
You know, I'm a vibe and I run it as usual
I didn't only come around just to make it
And I could shake things but I'll break it
You name it boy
Who knew I won't care for the things that you do?
I could turn let everyone try me
'Cause you never gonna get what is for me

No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have and good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

[Chorus]
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light, as it was
A log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
No, I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

[Bridge]
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright
So woman, no cry, cry, cry
No, woman, no (Woman, no)
So woman, no cry, no cry
No, woman, no cry

Vibez
But you knew that
It's Ladipoe

[Chorus: Buju]
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae
Spoil my blues and rhythm now
Oh oh oh oh
I like the way I'm feeling now
Omo e get small thing wey dey stress me
But right now I'm chilling now
Oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1: Ladipoe]
Way out my feelings and nothing can stress me
The way I run the game I'm feeling like referee
No like Moses parting the red sea
Like a chaffeur, me in the back of Bentley
So I step out all white can’t stain
What you want? Rosè? Champagne?
I got that, big bag, back pain
Taking the piss, the only time I can't aim
So we toast to the good life
Living every minute to the full cause I could die
Pull up at the spot open doors and it's suicide

Ladipoe, Fireboy and Vibez man
Here's another story from a bad man
Vibez
But you knew that

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Verse 1: Ladipoe]
Even though the country don dey tire me
I dey catch cruise, Eko Miami
If only bad news could be bribed, take all my money
I like my lies sweet, tastes like irony
But that's the reason, I dey vеx my nigga
Heavy is the head but forgеt my nigga
Crown don dey bend from the stress my nigga
It's getting hard to suppress my liquor
So I'm drinking more wine at four thirty
I'd rather be online than out with company
Man I'm tryna numb my mind, the thoughts are too heavy
'Cause life is no joke we cope with comedy
I really no dey see your face
That's why we switch lanes, no dey indicate
Everybody wan blow, who dey pick the date?
God when will I be the one that they imitate
But most times I feel no one can relate

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
When there's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

Galloping like I'm an antelope

Lone soldier me I dey stand alone
Me I dey fight for my envelope
But me I no fit to dey fight alone
Ou ha

[Verse 3: Ladipoe]
And you don't have to bro
What's a vaccine to an antidote
Blood, sweat, tears in my engine o
If you smell success that's my cologne
Broke almost every code
Still I got fans filling every row
This anointing from the microphone
And that's on God, only heaven knows

[Chorus: Fireboy DML]
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

[Outro: Ladipoe]
I've been running for life
Pastor said I've been running from life
Tank on E I'm just running on vibes
Sweet white wine with some Henny combined
Let me unwind
Coz it's heavy all night
I don't want any on mine
You can unfriend me online
I'm just running, running running on vibes
Yeah, but you knew that
It's Ladipoe

the song duduke is about “simi” unborn child that she can’t wait to see
“Duduke means – it’s the beat of your heart or the beat of the drums you move your body to, or the beat you sing a melody to – it’s whatever beat you want it to be
The beautiful singer who is currently expecting her first child with singer and hubby, Adekunle Gold, posted a totally adorable video of herself dancing to her new song, Duduke

You say you gonna let me down
If it were up to you, you woulda let me drown
Anywhere you dey me no fit settle down
No no oh
Ko si anybody to le tan mi
Ke ma foshi lo mi
I don’t fuck around, ask anybody to mo mi
No
You no be my enemy
But you ain’t no friend to me
Cause' people ride for the people that ride for them too
If you’re riding for me, then I’m riding with you
See I say what I mean, so I tell you the truth
And now we’re through (And now we're through)
Me I only give what I’m wanting
You do me right I match your enеrgy
Everybody need somebody good
Somebody nicе, somebody reliable
I’m just tryna keep my spirit pure
Stay the fuck away from immature people
It’s okay if I only have four people
As long as them be sure people

[Chorus: Simi Fave]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Are you, lo-lo-lo-loyal?
Lo-lo-lo-loyal
'Cause I'm, lo-lo-lo-loyal
(Tell me are you loyal?)
Lo-lo-lo-loyal
Loyal (Ooh yeah)
(Wake up, wake up)
Yeah

[Verse 2: FAVE]
Wake up wake up
Wanna see you later
These things that I got they don’t waver
Stick up stick up for me
I’ll see ya sooner than the dude at Bethsaida
Shey na wetin you talk
Shey na you wey comot
Make I open my door
What a fool I was
Brother don’t say what you cannot take back
I don’t roll that way bruh
I don’t like this fake love
Brother no way try dey keep your distance
Leave the hi for socials
All my guys them loyal
